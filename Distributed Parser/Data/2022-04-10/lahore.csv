0,FIA Lahore head ‘fearing govt change goes on leave’,"He is probing money laundering cases against Shehbaz Sharif and his son, Hamza.","LAHORE: Anticipating the change of government in the Centre, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) Lahore chief, who is probing into the money laundering cases against the joint opposition’s nominees for the slots of the prime minister and Punjab chief minister, Shehbaz Sharif and his son Hamza Shehbaz, respectively, has gone on leave for indefinite period.
According to a notification, FIA Lahore Director Mohammad Rizwan has gone on leave on full pay with effect from April 11, 2022, onward. A source in the FIA told Dawn on Saturday that Mr Rizwan had gone on leave anticipating his ‘certain transfer’ if there is a change in the federal government.
“The first order the new government may pass will be the transfer of Mr Rizwan with whom Shehbaz Sharif was not happy for, what he [Shehbaz] called, taking dictations from [former accountability adviser to the premier] Shehzad Akbar in the cases instituted against him and his family members at the behest of Prime Minister Imran Khan,” the source said. 
A special court (Central-I) of FIA is likely to indict Shehbaz and Hamza in Rs14 billion money laundering case on Monday (April 11). 
Last year, giving in to the demand of the lawmakers belonging to Jahngir Tareen group, the PTI government had removed Mr Rizwan from heading the investigation against Tareen and his son Ali Tareen in the sugar scam. However, the government later restored the officer.  
Now Mr Tareen and the lawmakers backing him have pledged their support for the joint opposition candidates for the top positions in the Centre and Punjab.  
The source says the FIA has already been directed to “go slow” in the cases against Tareen.
The FIA investigation under Mr Rizwan detected 28 benami accounts, allegedly of the Shehbaz family, through which an amount to the tune of Rs14bn was laundered from 2008 to 2018. The FIA examined the money trail of 17,000 credit transactions and the amount was kept in “hidden accounts” and given to Shehbaz in his personal capacity, the FIA said.
“This amount (Rs14bn) has nothing to do with the sugar business (of Shehbaz family). The money received through the accounts of low-wage employees by Shehbaz was transferred outside Pakistan via hundi/hawala networks, ultimately destined for beneficial use of his family members. In 1998 Sadiqa Syed, a Bahraini national, had helped Shehbaz Sharif (then chief minister of Punjab) in laundering $5 million with the help of Ishaq Dar (then federal finance minister),” the FIA documents said. 
The FIA nominated Shehbaz Sharif and his sons — Hamza and Suleman — as the principal accused in the case. Fourteen others have been named in the FIR under sections 5(2) and 5(3) (criminal misconduct) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, read with 3/4 of the Anti-Money Laundering Act.
Prime Minister Imran Khan reportedly had removed accountability adviser Akbar for his failure to get Shehbaz Sharif convicted in this case.

Saleem, a resident of 17 Kasi, exchanged heated arguments with his wife. The woman threw petrol and set him on fire. The locals shifted the victim to the Nishtar Hospital where he was said to be in a critical condition.  
The man’s family alleged that Saleem was set on fire by his wife and demanded registration of a case against her.

The PTI workers also burnt effigies of the dissident MPAs. The demonstrations were led by PTI Lahore President Sheikh Imtiaz and general secretary Zubair Khan Niazi. Former health minister Dr Yasmin Rashid, Mian Akram Usman, Awais Younas as well as workers participated in the protest demonstration.
Dr Yasmin Rashid said all political parties had forged unity in their ranks to oust Prime Minister Imran Khan. She stressed that people should come out otherwise looters would continue plundering the country and its progress would halt.
Dr Rashid also said the Chief Justice of Pakistan should not have sat on the bench for having clash of interest as she referred to his family relations with the opposition leader. 
She said the CJP had taken a suo motu notice and presided over the bench to decide dispute between the government and the opposition.  
She said the PTI government launched a number of initiatives for poor masses and talked about Health Card, Ehsaas Programme, interest-free loans for the youth, loans for construction of homes for homeless people and overseas Pakistanis given the right to vote.
Dr Rashid said the PTI government also fought very well against the coronavirus pandemic that was acknowledged in the comity of world nations.

3,Imran should not be allowed to wreak havoc on country: Maryam,Castigates premier for causing delay in voting on the no-confidence motion against him.,"LAHORE: PML-N Vice President Maryam Nawaz says Prime Minister Imran Khan should not be allowed to wreak havoc on the country.  
“One person (Imran) who is not in his senses anymore cannot be allowed to wreak havoc and bring the entire country down. This is not a joke. He should not be treated as PM or ex PM, he must be treated as a PSYCHOPATH who just to save his own skin is holding the entire country hostage. Shame,” Ms Nawaz said in a series of tweets on Saturday. 

 





 
She also castigated the premier for causing a delay in the voting on the no-confidence motion against him.  
“This blatant violation of constitution and disregard to SC orders will be ugly and end badly,” she said and added the country of 220 million had been without a government for weeks now.  

 





 
She also criticised Imran Khan for showering praise on India. She asked him to go to India if he liked it so much. She also reminded him that in India no prime minister ran away from the no-trust motion like him. “Imran is playing havoc with the constitution and democracy.”  
PPP Senator Sherry Rehman said in a tweet: “There’s an order of the Supreme Court holding the field but Imran Khan is refusing to let go of his chair and has called a cabinet mtg while MNAs remain in the parliament since 10 am this morning. This is pure malafide intent; desperate moves to get an NRO himself. #VotingKarao.”  

 





 
The Supreme Court on Thursday had reversed the dissolution of the National Assembly by President Dr Arif Alvi on April 3 and ordered Prime Minister Imran Khan to face the vote of no-confidence. The apex court also set aside the ruling of Deputy Speaker Qasim Suri that had blocked under Article 5 voting on the no-confidence move by holding it contrary to the Constitution.

4,Punjab Mazdoor Card still an unkept promise,Govt had set December 2021 as the deadline for issuance of cards.,"LAHORE: The Punjab government has ‘failed’ to fulfil its promise of launching “Punjab Mazdoor Card” to 1.2 million registered labourers across the province.
Punjab Employees Social Security Institution (PESSI) has announced plans to launch the labour card after opening accounts of 1.2 million workers with the help of the Bank of Punjab for the first time to ensure timely payment of financial benefits.
The labourers working against minimum wages were registered to provide them with ATM-based debit card and mobile vaults and it would give benefits such as concession of five to 45 per cent at more than 150 outlets (grocery, clothing etc.) to raise minimum wages close to the living wages.
The workers were being paid financial benefits under the social security at their homes through the PESSI Cash Benefit mobile app within 10 days.  

Govt had set December 2021 deadline for issuance of cards

The government also pledges to give other benefits, including 23 hospitals, 250 medical stores, student scholarships, maternity allowance, marriage and death grants, sickness benefits, disability pension and unemployment allowance through the card. The Mazdoor card would allow labourers to draw payment of salary through bank account and it would help ensure the minimum wage.
The government had set December 2021 deadline for issuance of the Mazdoor card but it was not issued to any labourer till to date [April 9].  
Labour leader Ghulam Haider told Dawn that the government had just registered the labourers and they were not given the Mazdoor cards.  
He said the government had only made an announcement of providing the cards but no worker was given the card and yet the minimum wage was also not implemented after registration of the workers.  
He said the workers were also not receiving health facilities as the cards were not issued to them and there was a lengthy process to avail the facility. “The labourers would have to suffer to get medical and other social security facilities,” he said.
PESSI Commissioner Bilal Haider told Dawn that as many as 30,000 cards were received and they were planning to hold a distribution ceremony.  
He said Prime Minister Imran Khan was to distribute the cards on March 28 but the ceremony could not be held due to cancellation of the visit. “The ceremony was not held due to the recent political turmoil in the country in the backdrop of no-confidence motion,” he said.
Mr Haider said they would distribute the first batch [of cards] among the labourers in a week or two. “The hand-made card is still active and labourers are getting medical facilities on the card but they could not avail concession on it,” he said.
Haider said the concession would be available on the Mazdoor card. “A second batch of 300,000 cards was also completed and its shipment would reach soon.”  
He said they would complete the distribution by the end of June and workers would get a discount of 5 to 45pc on more than 150 outlets.

Talking to Dawn, Shahid Nadeem, the moving spirit behind the theatre group, says: “Ajoka is planning to hold a two-day festival after Eid to mark the fourth death anniversary of Madeeha Gauhar.”  
In view of the 75th Independence Day celebrations, the festival will include Ajoka’s history plays such as Anhi Mai Da Sufna, (about the people left behind during Partition), Kaun Hai Yeh Gustakh, (about the life and suffering of Manto) and Mera Rang day Basanti Chola, (on freedom fighter Bhagat Singh).  
He says the festival will also include a documentary on Madeeha’s contribution to socially meaningful theatre. Eminent theatre personalities from India will also be invited to participate, on ground or online. The festival will be held in May at Alhamra and will also mark Ajoka’s 38th birthday, he says. 
Shahid Nadeem says the death anniversary [of Madeeha] falls on April 25 and owing to Ramazan, “we are planning to hold the festival after Eidul Fitr.”  
He says Punjabi writers, artistes and dramatists from across the border are also expected to participate. 
He says Ajoka will also stage a play Suicide Button, an outcome of Ajoka’s writing and acting class production. He says the play is not part of the festival and it will be a separate event.  
Ajoka has been holding three-month long acting and writing courses. The students after every three months come up with a production. Many new artistes have been introduced by Ajoka through these acting and writing classes. Shahid Nadeem is writing a new play as well which will be staged later this year.

7,Harking back: Will Wazir Khan mosque ‘hujras’ enlighten us?,"Many years ago when visiting a Berkeley University library dedicated to South Asian publications, I was shown a few...","Many years ago when visiting a Berkeley University library dedicated to South Asian publications, I was shown a few rare books. Among them in a glass case was a beautiful leather-bound edition of Ferdowsi’s ‘Shahnama’.
That book, which was purchased for almost a million US dollars in 2009, was a ‘Lahore Edition’, which is a rare book printed on handmade paper made inside Lahore’s walled city, its page edges beautifully hand-painted by women living inside the old city, exquisite lines done to utter perfection by amazing calligraphists and artists working in the ‘hujras’ outside the main mosque, the pages then bound by stationers in a ‘hujra’ and the leather bound in yet another ‘hujra’. Sounds so romantic, but then this is how things moved in those days, each specialty operating independently.
Outside the mosque in the open space in Mughal days the ‘karvans’ would settle around a camp fire, and books and other products that Lahore was famous for were sold, or auctioned as the case may be. So our amazing leather-bound books would then travel across Central Asia, and on to Turkey and beyond. Over the years as western countries became economically rich and acquired greater literacy levels, these books found greater appreciation. Hence today they can be found in the British Museum, as well as most European and American museums and libraries.  
One need not dwell on how we as a people have fared on the literary front, but what one can, and should, certainly talk about is the attempt by the Walled City of Lahore Authority to resurrect 15 ‘hujras’ in the outer courtyard of the mosque of Wazir Khan inside Delhi Gate. On Wednesday last, the 6th of April, 2022, they placed an advertisement in local newspapers inviting local artisans/ calligraphers in local arts and crafts to work in these famous ‘hujras’. The advertisement also invited entrepreneurs and organisations interested in working in any one of the 15 ‘hujras’ available. The 16th ‘hujra’ is occupied by the local ‘patwari’.  
This by any account is an excellent move and the authority should be commended and appreciated for this effort. It is something this newspaper column has been advocating for a long time. But then the WCLA advertisement makes it difficult for local small artisans from participating. For starters a genuine effort should be made to exclude the traders of Shahalami and other such markets from setting up shops and godown to sell cloth or utensils or other such items. The effort should be undertaken to have artisans themselves working in the ‘hujras’ and owning the business and its profits too. This should surely be the spirit of the effort.  
The effort to invite entrepreneurs and traders to these ‘hujras’ (shops) will kill the very spirit of the undertaking. This will invite the criticism that just where does the WCLA find the appropriate skilled artisans, calligraphers, book binders, leather binders for just one product like the ‘Lahore Edition’ marvel. But then these ‘hujras’ can, and should, house excellent craftsmen producing hats and caps, block printed fabrics on the premises as also hand-crafted shawls, hand-woven fabrics like genuine ‘khaddar’, hand-knotted carpets, hand-made ‘khussas’ and ‘chappals’. The wish list is endless.
It would be amazing if at least two miniature painters get a ‘hujra’ each. Our history needs such an effort. A good miniature painting can sell for at least Rs50,000 plus each. So one painting a week will be excellent earning, provided the quality is superb. The same goes for a quality ‘khussa’ maker. The possibilities are endless.
The list can go on and on, but the underlying consideration should be that every product should be locally produced, and of the highest quality and all made in the ‘hujra’. These suggested ‘guidelines’ are sure to bring forth the official response that they cannot guarantee such an outcome. The answer to this is that the small artisan, craftsperson, painter, calligraphist, book binder, and other such artistically-inclined person will not even read the advertisement. Maybe a few will pick it up hearsay, but it is sure to miss the vast majority of those who deserve just such a break.
So what should be done? The answer is for the various desk-ridden officials of the WCLA to walk through the entire walled city observing shops and workshops and production rooms, talking to the artisans and inviting them to participate. The entry should be free of cost. Surely the WCLA is expected to help the poor out. Our poor talented craftpersons need a break to truly contribute to the expected tourist ‘pull’ that these ‘hujras’ are bound to create.
It is a fact that most talented people work from their homes, now mostly in faraway places, as their poor families have sold their houses to traders. They need to be traced. Again when the WCLA ‘tracers’ walk the streets they are sure to ask shopkeepers about the best artisans and craftspersons of their area. To this they should also ask about those who have fled the ‘tyranny’ of the expanding traders.
Added to these considerations and suggested steps, it would not be a bad idea that the 15 ‘hujras’ should be divided into different crafts. Competition is healthy so two ‘hujras’ per trade is not a bad idea, but both not to the same person. This excellent WCLA idea needs to be handled with great care with a high quality outcome in mind.
As my mind thinks of new possibilities, it would not be a bad idea to allow one ‘hujra’ to a quality bookseller dedicated to selling books about Lahore and its history. The trick lies in planning a variety of crafted products that represent the true spirit of old Lahore. This will provide visitors and tourists the reason why Lahore is so special in the hearts and minds of its inhabitants, both present and past.
This brings us to a proposition that the WCLA should approach institutions functioning within the walled city who could use one ‘hujra’ to sell their quality products. For example, the Bazaar Hakeeman has two such institutions, both world famous. Inside each gateway are such people and institutions who should be approached.
This is an idea that needs to be appreciated, and taken forward in the spirit of bringing forward the best individuals and institutions of the walled city. As a precaution steps should be taken to not let them be used as godowns. They belong to the people and to our history, and the arts and crafts of our city need much greater exposure.

She said writers, intellectuals, besides film, TV and stage personalities would also be invited to the theatre festival.  
Ms Sadaf said that on the sidelines of the week-long festival, young students would be invited to hold short theatre workshops. The festival would be open to message-oriented and socially meaningful plays, she added. 
Besides holding cultural activities, she said Pilac had published six books on Punjabi poet Mian Muhammad Baksh and 11 more would be published soon on the legend.  
“Recently, a book on Munir Niazi’s Punjabi poetry titled ‘Kinna Turiye Hor’ had been published by Pilac. I have written its preface,” she said.
