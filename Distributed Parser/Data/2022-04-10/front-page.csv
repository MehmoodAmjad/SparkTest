• Asad Qaiser resigns, Ayaz Sadiq conducts session
• Motion of no-confidence passed by 174 votes

ISLAMABAD: After nearly a full day of high drama that culminated in the early hours of Sunday, the National Assembly expressed a lack of confidence in prime minister Imran Khan, thereby de-seating him from the highest office in the land.
The opposition’s struggle to remove the chief of the PTI from his office bore fruit just minutes before the midnight threshold, when Asad Qaiser resigned from the post of speaker National Assembly around 11:45pm, handing over charge of the lower house to former speaker Ayaz Sadiq — who is a member of the panel of chairpersons. 
Mr Sadiq first called for voting on the motion of no-confidence, then had to take a brief adjournment in order to condone the extension of Saturday’s NA sitting beyond midnight.
The session was then re-started, and voting on the no-confidence motion got underway in earnest. Members first signed the rolls and then went into division lobbies. The motion was passed by 174 votes after most treasury members walked out of the house.
It is now expected that nominations for the new prime minister will be submitted today (Sunday), while a vote to elect the new leader of the house — most likely Opposition Leader Shehbaz Sharif — will be held tomorrow (Monday).
But it may be days before we get to know what really transpired behind closed doors that led to these late night decisions.
A fluid situation
Events came to a head after iftar, when it seemed that the government was in no mood to hold voting and appeared to be heading towards possible contempt of court. 
Sources said that Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial and other judges who had given the verdict on April 7 also reached SC late at night in anticipation of another crisis.
The Islamabad High Court also sat late night to consider a couple of petitions; one regarding the apprehended removal of the army chief and another civil miscellaneous petition regarding the publicizing of a secret ‘threat letter’ from the US. However, both were disposed of.
Ahead of the speaker’s resignation, PM House remained the hub of political activities with party leaders and other notables rushing back and forth between the executive office and parliament. 
After presiding over a cabinet meeting around 9pm, the prime minister also spoke to a select group of journalists and told them about the cabinet’s decision to declassify the diplomatic cable. 
He again vowed to ‘fight till the last ball’ and said he would not let the foreign conspiracy succeed. He said at the most, the opposition could put him in jail. He said that he would not violate his oath and would not make any compromise. 
The prime minister also refuted the reports about any changes in the military leadership. 
‘Shuttle’ diplomacy
Sources said the speaker sent NA Secretariat officials to the nearby Supreme Court building around 10.30pm to extend an assurance that the resolution would be put before the house for the vote before midnight.
Meanwhile, opposition members remained inside the assembly hall and offered prayers, including Isha and Tarveeh on the floor of the house, in front of the speaker’s dais.
At the same time, PML-N leader Azam Nazeer Tarar also reached the Supreme Court, where he told reporters, he said they had come to submit a request before the SC asking it to implement its order since it seemed the government was bent upon creating a constitutional crisis. 
The Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) had also prepared a contempt of court petition, while lawyer Moulvi Iqbal Haider filed two different petitions, seeking contempt of court proceedings against the prime minister, the speaker as well as senior officials of the National Assembly Secretariat. 
Talking to reporters, before assembly proceedings re-started before midnight, Human Rights Minister Dr Shireen Mazari said the federal cabinet had decided to declassify and share the “threat letter” sent by the former envoy to Washington, with Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial and other top government functionaries, including the NA speaker and Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani.
Then, Asad Qaiser was summoned to PM House where the letter was shared with him. In his farewell remarks before the assembly, he noted that he was bound to uphold the Constitution and could not, in good faith, proceed with voting on a the resolution when he was convinced that a foreign conspiracy had been hatched against the government. 
Back in the house, the speaker appeared so unnerved after shuttling between the PM House and the Parliament House that he used unsavoury language when a journalist asked him if he would hold a vote on the no-confidence resolution. Outside, on Constitution Avenue, things also heated up, with military and police vehicles lining up outside.
Speaking in the assembly after the motion was passed, Shehbaz Sharif assured all sides that they would not seek retribution after coming into power.
Meanwhile, Attorney General for Pakistan Khalid Jawed Khan has tendered resignation. 
In his resignation to President Dr Arif Alvi  he stated that he had served as AGP since Feb 2020 and for this honour and privilege he remained profoundly grateful to Prime Minister Imran Khan and that he tried to serve the country to the best of his ability and conscience.

1,No PM completed five-year term,Imran Khan is the first prime minister who has been removed through a no-confidence motion.,"ISLAMABAD: Since the country came into being in 1947, no elected prime minister has ever completed their five-year term in office, and Imran Khan is the 19th person on this list.
Mr Khan, however, is the first prime minister who has been removed through the constitutional move of a no-confidence resolution. 
The country’s first prime minister Liaquat Ali Khan had been assassinated on October 16, 1951. After him, seven prime ministers resigned, five faced dismissals, while the governments of four prime ministers were ousted through military coups. Nawaz Sharif and Yousuf Raza Gilani were the two who were disqualified due to their convictions by the Supreme Court. 
Shaukat Aziz, Raja Pervez Ashraf and Shahid Khaqan Abbasi relinquished the office on the completion of the five-year term of the National Assembly, but they had assumed the charge only to complete the remaining term after the disqualification and resignation of their predecessors.     
The list includes Nawaz Sharif, who is the only person who had had to quit the country’s top office four times during his three terms. Mr Sharif, however, has to his credit the longest stay in the PM’s Office  with 3,422 days. Imran Khan is at number six in terms of the number of days spent in office with 1,335 days, followed by Benazir Bhutto, Liaquat Ali Khan, Yousuf Raza Gilani and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.

2,PTI to move SC seeking review of order on no-trust vote,ISLAMABAD: Hours before the late-night vote on the no-confidence resolution against Imran Khan took place in the...,"ISLAMABAD: Hours before the late-night vote on the no-confidence resolution against Imran Khan took place in the National Assembly, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) had on Saturday finalised a draft review petition seeking revision of the April 7 short order of the Supreme Court that had set aside the deputy speaker’s ruling dismissing the no-trust resolution and the subsequent dissolution of the assembly by the president.
The PTI planned to move the review petition before the apex court on Monday.
The review petition has been prepared by the PTI’s legal team consisting of Babar Awan and Azhar Siddique and was to be filed on Saturday, but could not be instituted as the court had closed for the day.
It also seeks a stay against the court’s April 7 directions that require National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser to conduct a vote on the joint opposition’s no-trust motion. It pleads that the April 7 short order, in the absence of any detailed reasons, was not a judicial determination in the context of Article 184(3) read with Article 189 of the Constitution.
The PTI has argued that the apex court has erred in appreciating that the no-confidence motion against the prime minister had lapsed due to afflux of time as contained in Article 95(2) of Constitution, and therefore any direction to consider/hear/proceed on it was a direct violation of the stated mandate of the Constitution.
Moreover, all subsequent proceedings of the National Assembly will also be bad in law and the Constitution, the review petition argues, adding the no-confidence proceedings and election for a new prime minister have been elaborately provided in the Constitution. Therefore, the Supreme Court is not entitled to micro-manage the affairs of parliament, the document emphasises.
It also argues that despite an open court announcement of the short order, the Supreme Court has erred by not rendering any decision on the presidential reference moved to seek interpretation of Article 63A of the Constitution that deals with defection, adding that its decision was of paramount importance.
Meanwhile, the Supreme Court will resume hearing on the pending presidential reference on Article 63A from Tuesday. Headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial, a five-judge bench is hearing the reference, which was moved through Attorney General of Pakistan (AGP) Khalid Jawed Khan.
The reference has requested the apex court that the most suitable and appropriate disqualification for a declared defector should be disqualification for life as provided under Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution since the constantly recurring defection was a self-feeding menace.
“Such members must never be allowed to return to parliament nor their tainted votes be counted in any constitutional or democratic exercise,” the reference emphasises.
The AGP has already argued before the Supreme Court whereas senior counsel Makhdoom Ali Khan was representing the Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Shehbaz Sharif and the PML-N.
The reference has asked “whether keeping in view the scheme and spirit of the Constitution, which enshrines democratic values, customs and norms and provides for a parliamentary form of government conducted through the chosen representatives of the people being carriers of Amanat, which interpretation of Article 63A should be adopted and implemented to achieve the constitutional objective of curbing the menace of defections and purification of the electoral process and democratic accountability”.
“Where a member engages in constitutionally prohibited and morally reprehensible act of defection, can the member nevertheless claim a vested right to have his vote counted and given equal weightage or there exist or was to be read into the constitution a restriction to exclude such tainted votes from the vote count?” it wonders.

3,PTI moves against ‘defectors’,"In letters to NA speaker, party seeks disqualification of around 20 lawmakers...","ISLAMABAD: Even before voting on the no-confidence motion, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) sought the disqualification of its defecting MNAs on Saturday. 
However, according to one of the leaders of the opposition alliance, disqualification cannot be enforced upon “based on mere intentions”.
The request seeking disqualification of the parliamentarians was submitted to National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser by Amir Dogar, chief whip of the ruling party in the lower house of parliament.
The letter is titled, “Declaration for disqualification on grounds of defection under article 63-A(1a) of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973”.

In letters to NA speaker, party seeks disqualification of around 20 lawmakers

Around 20 letters were submitted for each of the MNAs who had announced their lack of trust in the leadership of Imran Khan.
The letters were written on behalf of PTI Chairman Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi, highlighting the names of the MNAs elected on PTI tickets.
The letter added that the information was available on the media, including broadcast and videos circulated on different forums, that the MNAs had left the PTI parliamentary party and joined the opposition benches, who have brought a motion of vote of no-confidence against the prime minister on March 8, 2022.
The contents of the videos shown by the media, the letter said, were neither denied nor were rebuttals issued by the members in question.
The PTI has also referred to show cause notices issued to members on March 31, 2022, where the opportunity was provided to them to appear before the “Head of the Parliamentary Party” and clarify why a declaration may not be issued against them, in compliance with constitutional provisions.
The letter to the speaker added that the said MNAs failed to respond or reply, and did not even provid an adequate response to the show cause notices.
On the other hand spokesman, PPP Sindh spokesperson Saeed Ghani has said that action can only be taken against MNAs when they vote against the party line in the election of the prime minister, finance bill or in a vote of no-confidence against the PM.
“The idea that any member was planning to vote against the prime minister of the party they got elected from… the law is not based on intentions,” he added.

4,PML-Q seeks to be party to plea against PA speaker,"Hamza challenges transfer of Punjab chief secretary, police chief...","LAHORE: The Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid (PML-Q) on Saturday filed an application before the Lahore High Court to become a party in the petition of Leader of the Opposition in the Punjab Assembly Hamza Shehbaz, and against the alleged detention of its MPAs by the opposition. 
Hamza Shehbaz had moved the high court on Friday challenging the Punjab Assembly speaker’s act of not convening a session to elect a new chief minister of the province and withdrawing the deputy speaker’s powers. 
Advocate Amir Saeed Rawn filed the application on behalf of PML-Q secretary general Kamil Ali Agha, alleging the opposition had held his party MPAs hostage in a hotel and barred them from meeting anyone, even their family members. He said the applicant was a duly registered party with the election commission, but the respondent (Hamza) along with others had been trying to change the loyalty of its members illegally and against the Constitution. 
He said the applicant, the PML-Q, was a necessary party in the case, but the petitioner (Hamza) did not make the former a party in the petition pending before the court. He asked the court to allow the application and implead the applicant party (PML-Q) in the pending petition of Hamza Shehbaz. 

Hamza challenges transfer of Punjab chief secretary, police chief

Transfers/Postings: Leader of the Opposition Hamza Shehbaz, also a nominee of the joint opposition for the Punjab chief minister’s post, on Saturday moved the Lahore High Court against the transfers of government officers, including the provincial chief secretary and police chief, having been made by interim chief minister Usman Buzdar. 
Hamza challenged the transfers through a civil miscellaneous application filed in his already pending main petition against the Punjab Assembly speaker for not holding the chief minister’s election. 
The application, filed through Advocate Khalid Ishaq, contended that no provincial cabinet or government existed in the province after the resignation of Mr Buzdar. No transfer and posting of officers, such as the chief secretary and inspector general of police (IGP) of the province, could be made without the consultation of the provincial government. 
It argued that once the process of election was set in motion, the matter of transfers/postings had to be halted since such moves had all the trappings of unfair, partial and arbitrary interference in the election process. 
“Such a practice of postings and transfers during the election process has always been deprecated and set aside by the honourable courts,” the application adds. 
It asked the court to restrain the government from making unlawful transfers and postings of the chief secretary and the IGP during the process for the election of a chief minister. 
Both applications would be heard by Chief Justice Muhammad Ameer Bhatti on Monday along with the main petition wherein the speaker and the provincial assembly secretary had already been directed to present complete record of the election for the post of the CM.

5,Water crisis on horizon as snow melts at snail’s pace,"“The situation is more precarious in Mangla, which is hosting less than 1pc of its capacity,” says Irsa official.","LAHORE: Despite an early onset of summer in mid-March and April getting hotter than usual, the snow melting process in mountainous and hilly areas has not picked up pace, putting profound pressure on the national water supplies and making the planners quite nervous. 
For the last 10 days, national water supplies have dipped substantially below not only last year’s levels, but average supplies of the last five or 10 years for the day, forcing Pakistan to start its Kharif season with close to a 40 per cent shortage in both of its water-producing systems — 30pc in Indus and 10pc in the Jhelum arm. 
“The situation is more precarious in Mangla, which is hosting less than 1pc of its capacity,” says Khalid Rana of the Indus River System Authority (Irsa).
On Saturday, Mangla held only 354,000 acre-feet against over seven million of its capacity. This is largely because the Mangla Lake is mainly rain-fed and there has virtually been no rain during March. The Met Office predicted five spells of rain, but only one took place.
“To make matters worse, 37 inches of snow fell this winter against the yearly average of 50 inches — a drop of 26pc. Even those 37 inches seem to have fallen on higher altitudes, where the temperature needs to be more than the current 23 degrees Celsius to melt it. These trends — less and high altitude snow and virtually no rain — have created a crisis in the Jhelum arm,” Mr Rana explains.
“The same trend seems to have impacted River Chenab as well,” explains an official of the Punjab Irrigation Department. The flows are improving, but too slowly to benefit the system — widening the gap between demand and supply.
On Saturday, the river was flowing at 22,000 cusecs against the last 10-year average of 25,000 cusecs. The Saturday flows included almost 30pc improvement; otherwise, it was flowing at 15,000 cusecs when the month started. So, the entire water-producing system has receded to a low level, and is not benefitting from the high temperatures, the official maintains. 
The national water flow data, compiled by the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda), explains the extent of water poverty. On Saturday, the country received 90,000 cusecs in all its rivers against the last 10-year average of 137,700 cusecs — a drop of 27.73pc.
Individually speaking, Jhelum provided 27,200 cusecs against its 10-year average of 48,200 cusecs; River Kabul was flowing at 12,900 cusecs against the average of 32,600 cusecs; Indus provided 27,500 cusecs against its average of 31,200 cusecs and Chenab chimed in with 22,200 cusecs against the average of 25,700 cusecs. 
“Even the temperatures in Skardu have doubled — from 11 degree Celsius last year to 22.2 degree on Saturday — but snow melting has not increased,” says a Wapda official dealing with the snow and its melting phenomenon. “We can still give a benefit of the doubt to river flows as they involve two to three days of lag when water leaves the mountains and reaches Tarbela Dam. The entire snow will eventually reach the rivers, but the current delay remains a cause of concern. 
“Tarbela and Mangla lakes are almost at dead level and not improving due to the absence of rains and snow melt,” Sahibzada Khan, director general of the meteorological department, said.
The trend is expected to hold for another month or so before it improves by the end of May or beginning of June, when both high temperatures and rains would start benefitting the system.
