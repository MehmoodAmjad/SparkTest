0,Plan to involve private sector in Leh Nullah expressway project dropped,"Centre to bear 60pc, Punjab 40pc of total cost, official says.","RAWALPINDI: In a new development, the Punjab government took a U-turn and decided to construct the Leh Nullah and Flood Channel through government funds instead of involving the private sector.
A senior official of the Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA) told Dawn that earlier the construction of the channel on public-private partnership (PPP) mode had been approved under which the government would procure land while a private company would construct and operate the expressway.
However, he said, a new plan had been prepared and the project would be launched in the next fiscal year, adding that for an environment impact assessment (EIA), a public hearing would be held on May 11.
“Under the new plan, the Punjab government would allocate Rs65 billion for the construction of the Leh Nullah and dual carriageway while Rs25 billion would be spent on land acquisition. The expressway will stretch from New Katarian on I.J. Principal Road to Soan Bridge near Lahore High Court (LHC) Rawalpindi bench,” he said.

Centre to bear 60pc, Punjab 40pc of total cost, official says

The official said the total width of the concrete nullah and dual carriageway at New Katarian would be 55 metres and it would gradually increase to 80 metres at the ending point near Soan Bridge.
“The federal government will provide 60pc of the fund while the Punjab government will bear 40pc of the total cost,” he added.
The official said earlier PC-I for land acquisition and structural compensation amounting to Rs25 billion had been approved by Ecnec in its meeting held on December 22, 2021, and administrative approval was given on January 19, 2022.
However, he said Ecnec approved the project with conditions that the EIA study would be conducted before the project execution.
He said EIA would be carried out and its conditions fulfilled prior to the launch of the project, adding that the implementation period of the project was six months.
In an earlier plan, commercial buildings and zones were to be constructed under the urban regeneration programme. 
On the directives of the government, Nespak was preparing the plan of urban regeneration along the nullah.
“The basic aim of urban regeneration was to reduce the cost of land acquisition which the government considered was still high,” the official said, adding that the government had estimated that Rs35 billion would be required for the Leh expressway project.
But the plan was shelved when the political crisis deepened in the country and the MNA from Rawalpindi 
Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, who is also interior minister, wanted to start the project before the dismissal of the PTI government.
About the PPP mode, the senior official said there were fewer investors interested in the project because urban regeneration plan along Leh Nullah was time consuming and difficult to collect land from the private land owners.
When contacted, RDA Chief Engineer Dr Habibullah Randhawa confirmed that the new plan was being made for Leh expressway project.
He said the government wanted to start the project as soon as possible and had decided to construct concrete structure and roads along the nullah.
To a question, he said the Public-Private Partnership Authority would soon take up the matter to cancel the project launched under the PPP mode. He said public hearing for EIA would be held on May 11 and till then a detail plan would be completed.

The victim, Shahida Bibi, resident of Bhalaser village, while narrating her ordeal to journalists on Friday, said on Feb 24 she was going to fetch water when three persons of the same locality started filming her with their mobile phones.
When she asked them to stop, the victim said, they subjected her to severe torture during which she lost one of her teeth. She said when she called Rescue 15, a police party took her to the police station instead of Tehsil Headquarters (THQ) Hospital for medical examination and registered no case against the persons involved.
The police registered a case without medical examination as they wanted to create a way for the persons involved to seek relief from the local court through pre-arrest bail, she claimed, adding that the three later broke into her house and subjected her to more torture because she refused to withdraw the case against them.
She said they tore her clothes, shaved her head and eyebrows. She claimed that they belonged to an influential family, which was why the police were reluctant to take action against them.
Upon being contacted, Investigation Officer Najeebullah rejected the allegations of the woman, adding that police took action promptly. He said the woman reported the matter to police on April 6 and they registered a case under sections 352, 354, 337-V-2,506 and 34 of the Pakistan Penal code (PPC).

6,IHC deplores state functionaries for not addressing Baloch students’ grievances,Chief justice asks President Alvi to dispel impression of racial profiling.,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) deplored the conduct of the president and state functionaries for not addressing the legitimate concerns of Baloch students protesting in Islamabad against disappearance of their missing colleague.
IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah asked President Dr Arif Alvi to dispel the impression of racial profiling of the Baloch students.He was hearing a petition filed by rights activist Imaan Zainab Hazir against harassment of the protesting students.
The students belonging to Balochistan and at present studying at the Quaide-i-Azam University (QAU) apprehended that they would be harassed and abducted if they visited their hometowns. 
The court observed: “The most alarming and disturbing aspect observed by the Court during the proceedings in hand has been the conduct of the public office holders and the lack of empathy on their part. The students have endeavored to be heard by the public functionaries but their conduct has remained indifferent.”

Chief justice asks President Alvi to dispel impression of racial profiling

The court noted that “There cannot be a graver grievance for a citizen to feel that he/she is being subjected to racial profiling or is not being treated equally. The court deprecates the conduct of the public office holders as has been observed during the proceedings.”
The court directed the secretary to the president to place a copy of the order before him. The grievance regarding racial profiling cannot and must not be tolerated. In case of students of Balochistan such a grievance becomes more profound.
“The Chancellor of the University i.e. worthy President of Pakistan is expected to take appropriate action, in consultation with the Chancellors of other Universities, so as to demonstrably dispel any apprehension regarding racial profiling of students belonging to the province of Balochistan,” it added.
“But what is most alarming is the response of the State and its public functionaries. The Minister of Interior had met them pursuant to the Court’s direction but the meeting appears to have been a mere formality,” the court order said, adding: “The Chancellor of the University i.e. the worthy President has not met them as yet.”
A deputy attorney general informed the court that the chancellor of the university - the president - had set a date to meet the students, but on account of unavoidable circumstances it could not be materialised.
He added that the president was given a briefing by the secretary, Ministry of Interior.
The court noted that the grievances raised by the students were not only intolerable but they manifested one of the most gravest forms of violations of the fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution.
The secretary Ministry of Interior was directed to reach out to the petitioners and the students of Balochistan at the QAU and take such actions as he may deem appropriate to ensure that concerns relating to security while visiting their hometowns are addressed.
The court directed the registrar office to send copies of the order to the secretary to the president and the secretary Ministry of Interior are direct them to submit their reports before the date fixed.
Further hearing in the matter was adjourned till April 15.

Speaking at a fundraiser for Shaukat Khanum Hospital, Mr Khan said the best welfare states were the Scandinavian countries which were now prosperous and peaceful because of the policies for the benefit of humanity.

Mr Khan said more hospitals were needed in Pakistan to treat patients of cancer. 
“About 40 years ago, I thought of establishing the cancer hospital and despite difficulties accomplished the task,” the prime minister said, adding that if cancer was detected early, the disease could be treated. 
He appreciated the nation for coming together to build and run Shaukat Khanum Hospital. 
He said Pakistanis were ahead of other nations when it came to giving charity. It was mandatory for the Muslims to give Zakat and the practice gave an opportunity to help poor people, he noted. 
He said Pakistani nation had given Rs63 billion as charity for treatment of cancer patients in the Shaukat Khanum Hospital. 
“We will fulfill our promise to the nation that 70pc of the patients in the hospital will be treated freely,” PM Khan said.

In response to a question from MNA Shazia Marri about factors that led to the increase in the prices of food essentials in particular and other commodities in general, the Ministry of Industries and Production said the price of raw palm oil had increased from $760 per tonne in January 2020 to $1,352 per tonne in January 2022.
As the ministry only dealt with two essential commodities - sugar and edible oil - prices of essential commodities rose due to the increase in raw material cost of sugarcane and palm oil.
Secondly, given the supply and demand situation, the prices of sugar increased manifold during the tenure of the incumbent government.
The government maintained that in recent years there was a drastic decrease in the production of sugar, and high prices of sugarcane were paid to farmers. Drawing a comparison, the ministry elaborated that during the crushing year 2017-18, 6.61 million metric tonnes sugar was produced while consumption stood at 5.20 metric tonnes. However, in 2020-21, 5.69 metric tonne sugar was produced while consumption increased to over 5.80 metric tonnes.
In response to another question from Ms Marri, the ministry said the government had been providing five essential commodities - flour, ghee, sugar, rice and pulses - on reduced or subsidised prices through utility stores since January 2020.
The reduced/subsidised prices of these basic commodities were implemented at utility stores across the country. After the subsidy, the price of non-subsidised 20kg bag of flour was reduced from Rs1,400 to Rs950. The price of non-subsidised sugar was reduced from Rs95 to Rs85 per kg at utility stores.
As price of ghee was reduced from Rs380 to Rs260, price of super banaspati rice was reduced from Rs150 to Rs140, tota basmati from Rs96 to Rs84 and sella rice was now available at Rs139 against Rs149.
Similarly, pulses such as Dal Channa price was reduced from Rs182 to Rs162, Dal Masoor from Rs235 to Rs215 and the price of white gram from Rs233 to Rs213.
The ministry claimed that since January 2020, 100.48 million households had been served.
