0,FBR issues details of incentives-laden industrial amnesty,"Scheme aims to boost industrialisation, revive sick units, spur foreign investment.","ISLAMABAD: The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) on Saturday issued details of the amnesty scheme for industrial sector and encouraged entrepreneurs to invest in industrial undertaking out of their undisclosed assets.
The details were issued in an income tax circular 13 of 2022. The amnesty package is laden with incentives for three areas including industrial promotion, revival of sick units and foreign investment in industrial sector.
As per details, the incentives are provided in the form of adjustment of business losses by acquiring the company. A new section 59C has been inserted in the Ordinance under which an acquiring company is allowed to adjust loss for the latest tax year and brought forward assessed business losses, excluding capital loss, of acquired company flick industrial unit’) by way of acquisition of its majority share capital.
The acquiring company can adjust said losses for a period of three tax years up to tax year 2026. Failure to revive sick industrial unit by tax year 2026 will entail acquiring company to reverse the adjustment of loses in the preceding three tax years and offer income for tax which was set-off due to adjustment of loses of the acquiring company in tax year 2027.

Scheme aims to boost industrialisation, revive sick units, spur foreign investment

The acquiring company is entitled to adjust the said losses in proportion to share capital acquired subject to the conditions. Any leftover loss of acquired company by the end of tax year 2026 will not be available to the acquiring company for further set-off of losses in tax year 2027 against its own income, however, the acquired company can carry forward its losses in accordance with section 57 of the Ordinance.
The benefit under this section will not be available to any scheme of amalgamation or merger. The definition of a sick industrial unit, whose losses are available for adjustment under this scheme, has been provided in this section. Revival of sick industrial unit requires attaining maximum production capacity that was obtained before such company went sick. Such revival will be certified by the Engineering Development Board and the acquired company is required to file said certificate along with return of income for tax year 2026.
In order to provide incentive for industrial promotion, section 65H has been inserted in the Ordinance whereby all non-resident Pakistani citizens having non-resident status for more than five years and resident Pakistani citizens can avail the benefit of one hundred per cent one-time tax credit equal to the amount invested as equity from foreign exchange remitted into Pakistan through normal banking channel in a dedicated rupee account opened by a company incorporated on or after March 1, 2022 to establish an industrial undertaking.

1,WB resumes processes for Kishenganga and Ratle hydro plants,"The decision has been formally communicated in letters to India and Pakistan, World Bank says.","ISLAMABAD: The World Bank has announced its decision to resume the two separate processes requested by Pakistan and India in relation to the Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric power plants, in line with its responsibilities under the Indus Waters Treaty.
The decision has been formally communicated in letters to India and Pakistan, a World Bank press release said. The two countries disagree over whether the technical design features of the two hydroelectric plants contravene the Indus Waters Treaty.
Pakistan had asked the World Bank to facilitate setting up a Court of Arbitration to consider its concerns about the designs of the two hydroelectric power projects, while India asked for the appointment of a Neutral Expert for the same purpose.
In December 2016, the World Bank declared a pause in the two separate processes to allow the two countries to consider alternative ways to resolve their disagreements. Since then, the World Bank has encouraged and worked with both countries to seek an amicable resolution. Multiple high-level meetings have been convened and a variety of proposals have been discussed.
The World Bank continues to share the concerns of the parties that carrying out the two appointments concurrently poses practical and legal risks. However, the lack of success in finding an acceptable solution over the past five years is also a risk to the treaty itself.
In deciding to resume the two processes, the bank has carefully considered the views of all parties involved. The World Bank remains committed to acting in good faith and with complete impartiality and transparency while continuing to assist the countries and fulfilling its responsibilities under the treaty.
Several procedural options for resolving the disagreement over the interpretation of the treaty’s provisions had been discussed between a Pakistan delegation and World Bank officials in May 2018. Both sides discussed issues regarding the treaty and opportunities within the treaty to seek an amicable resolution.
Several procedural options for resolving the disagreement over the interpretation of the treaty’s provisions have already been discussed between Pakistan and the World Bank. While an agreement on the way forward was not achieved after the meeting, the World Bank had pledged to continue to work with both countries to resolve the issues in an amicable manner and in line with the treaty provisions.
The Indus Waters Treaty is a profoundly important international agreement that provides an essential cooperative framework for India and Pakistan to address current and future challenges of effective water management to meet human needs and achieve development goals.
As a signatory to the treaty, the World Bank’s role is limited and procedural. In particular, the role in relation to “differences” and “disputes” is limited to the designation of people to fulfill certain roles when requested by either or both parties.
The disagreement between India and Pakistan concerns the design features of the Kishenganga (330 megawatts) and Ratle (850 megawatts) hydroelectric power plants. The former was inaugurated in 2018 while the latter is under construction. The World Bank is not financing either project.
The two countries disagree over whether the technical design features of these two hydroelectric plants contravene the treaty. The plants are located in India on tributaries of the Jhelum and the Chenab rivers, respectively. The treaty designates these two rivers, as well as the Indus, as the “Western Rivers” to which Pakistan has unrestricted use with some exceptions. Under the treaty, India is permitted to construct hydroelectric power facilities on these rivers, subject to constraints specified in annexures to the treaty.

2,Stocks retreat in tumultuous week,KARACHI: Trading on the stock market began in the outgoing week with a bloodbath that resulted in the benchmark...,"KARACHI: Trading on the stock market began in the outgoing week with a bloodbath that resulted in the benchmark shedding 1,250 points in a single day. This happened after a surprising dismissal of the no-confidence motion by the National Assembly’s deputy speaker — an act that led to the temporary dissolution of the National Assembly.
Moreover, the rupee depreciated to its all-time low of 188 amid sliding foreign exchange reserves and the ongoing political uncertainty, said Arif Habib Ltd.
This necessitated a massive policy rate hike of 250 basis points to 12.25 per cent. The bourse welcomed the revival of investors’ confidence after the Supreme Court’s judgment overturning the deputy speaker’s dismissal of the vote. In addition, decreasing oil prices in the global markets further added to the gains in share prices, the brokerage added.
As a result, the KSE-100 index closed at 44,445 points, down 1.56pc week-on-week.
Sector-wise, negative contributions came from cement (314 points), oil and gas exploration (89 points), power generation and distribution (80 points), engineering (65 points) and food and personal care (60 points).
According to AKD Securities, the stock market will likely remain buoyant over the next couple of trading sessions and then the reality of higher interest rates and a fluid economic situation will finally start settling in.
“Market participation during Ramazan may continue to remain limited. However, the commencement of the result season could bring investors’ interest to specific stocks. We continue to advise investors for building long-term positions and limiting short-term trading,” it added.

3,Industry slams steep hike in interest rate,"This harsh measure will badly affect the growth of business activities and hurt exports, says ICCI president.","ISLAMABAD: The rec­ent decision of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to increase the interest rate has received widespread condemnation from the business community and political circles.
Islamabad Chamber of Commerce & Industry (ICCI) President Muh­amm­ad Shakeel Munir criticised the SBP’s decision to make a steep hike of 2.5 per cent in benchmark interest rate and taking it to 12.25pc. This harsh measure would badly affect the growth of business activities and hurt exports, said Mr Munir. 
In a meeting of the business community of federal capital here on Saturday, the ICCI president said the policy interest rate was 4pc in India, 4.75pc in Bangladesh, 3.7pc in China, 0.5pc in Thailand and 0.75pc in Hong Kong, but it has been increased to 12.25pc in Pakistan, which was almost the highest in the region.
He warned that this massive hike in the policy interest rate would adversely affect all sectors of the economy and lead to further downfall in the trade and industrial activities.
He urged that the SBP should immediately revisit and withdraw this irrational increase as it would prove disastrous for the economy.
Meanwhile, in an interview to a private channel, SBP Governor Dr Reza Baqir said the recent drop in foreign exchange reserves was worrisome, although a rollover of foreign loans is expected to improve the situation soon. 
Other recent measures by the central bank will also help stop the worsening of foreign exchange reserves, he added. 
The SBP governor further said the decline in reserves was mainly due to debt servicing and the payment with regards to the settlement of an international arbitration award.
The ICCI president said that the economy was already facing many great challenges including rising inflation, sharp currency devaluation, unbearable foreign debt, depleting foreign exchange reserves, growing fiscal imbalances and dwindling foreign direct investments.
He urged the SBP to reconsider its decision and reduce the interest rate to make credit cost affordable for business class.
The ICCI members noted that the even in the past, governments used the policy of increasing interest rate to control inflation, but this policy has failed miserably.
Meanwhile, former finance minister and the PML-N leader Miftah Ismail said the hike in the interest rate was due to the failed economic policies of the Imran Khan government.
“We are witnessing a slide in foreign exchange reserves and constant downward positioning of the rupee against the dollar,” he said.

4,Sri Lanka to seek $3bn to stave off crisis: minister,"The country has $12.55bn in outstanding international sovereign bonds, central bank data shows.","COLOMBO: Sri Lanka will need about $3 billion in external assistance in the next six months to help restore supplies of essential items including fuel and medicine, its finance minister told Reuters on Saturday.
The island nation of 22 million people has been hit by prolonged power cuts and shortages which have drawn protesters out on to the streets and put President Gotabaya Rajapaksa under mounting pressure.
“It’s a Herculean task,” Finance Minister Ali Sabry said in his first interview since taking office this week, referring to finding $3 billion in bridge financing as the country readies for negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) this month.
The country will look to restructure international sovereign bonds and seek a moratorium on payments, and is confident it can negotiate with bondholders over a $1 billion payment due in July.
“The entire effort is not to go for a hard default,” Sabry said.  “We understand the consequences of a hard default.”
J.P. Morgan analysts estimated this week that Sri Lanka’s gross debt servicing would amount to $7 billion this year, with a current account deficit of around $3 billion.
The country has $12.55bn in outstanding international sovereign bonds, central bank data showed, and foreign reserves of $1.93bn at the end of March.
“The first priority is to see that we get back to the normal supply channel in terms of fuel, gas, drugs... and thereby electricity so that the people’s uprising can be addressed,” Sabry said.
Anti-government protests have raged across the island for days, with at least one turning violent in the commercial capital of Colombo, in a threat to the country’s lucrative tourism industry.
“We respect your right to protest, but no violence, because it is counterproductive,” Sabry said.
“Our tourism, which was beautifully coming back in February with 140,000 tourists coming in, has been severely affected ever since the demonstrations.”
Talks with IMF
Sabry said he will lead a delegation of Sri Lankan officials to Washington to start talks with the IMF on April 18 and that financial and legal advisers would be selected within 21 days to help the government restructure its international debt.
“Once we go to them, first thing is there is a sense of confidence in the entire international monetary community that we are serious,” he said.  “We are transparent, we are willing to engage.” 
On Friday, a new central bank governor raised interest rates by an unprecedented 700 basis points in a bid to tame rocketing inflation and stabilise the economy.
Sri Lankan authorities will also reach out to rating agencies, Sabry said, as the country looks to regain access to international financial markets after being locked out due to multiple ratings downgrades since 2020.
Sabry said the government will raise taxes and fuel prices within six months and seek to reform loss-making state-owned enterprises.
These measures were among key recommendations in an IMF review of Sri Lanka’s economy released in early March.
“These are very unpopular measures, but these are things we need to do for the country to come out of this,” Sabry said.  “The choice is do you do that or do you go down the drain permanently?”—Reuters

A Sales Tax General Order No. 12 of 2022 was issued on Saturday to notify the lists in order to stop the misuse of the input tax adjustment.
The FBR notified 348 items that will not be eligible for input tax adjustments for the oil and ghee sector and another 430 for steel sector. 
The analysis of the data available in the system has led to conclude that the facilities/benefits provided through automated sales tax returns are being misused by the manufacturers of oil and ghee and steel melters and re-rolling mills who are claiming inputs other than their relevant business activities in violation of provisions of law.

6,Action advised against GE for ‘causing’ loss of Rs10.8bn,Power Division says Genco Holding Company Limited Board of Directors has not taken this matter seriously.,"LAHORE: The Ministry of Energy (Power Division) has expressed grave concern over non-implementation of the recommendations of an inquiry report including an action against a leading multinational company for allegedly causing loss of Rs10.8 billion for non-functioning one of the turbines installed by it at 747MW Guddu Power Plant (GPP).
The Power Division further advised the Genco Holding Company Limited (GHCL) Board of Directors (BoD) to take action in line with the recommendations which include suspension of GHCL CEO as well as action against General Electric (GE). 
“It has been noticed that the GHCL CEO is still working despite written orders from this division on March 31. It is observed with serious concern that the GHCL BoD has not taken this matter seriously despite the fact that the issue involves massive loss to the public exchequer,” reads a letter the Power Division wrote to the GHCL BoD Chairman on April 8.
The division, according to the letter, is also required to justify the delay in finalising the selection of the GHCL CEO which apparently has taken undue time. Needless to point out that the inordinate delay in the process might create doubt about the impartiality of the board. “Foregoing in view, the GHCL BoD is directed to implement the directions conveyed vide the letter issued on March 31, 2022 without any further delay and fail,” the ministry said. 
It may be mentioned that gas turbine-14 of the combined cycle GPP surprisingly started malfunctioning in February last year and eventually went out of order. The initial investigations reached a consensus that the unit went non-operational after some of its internal parts damaged reportedly. The initial investigation was conducted by the Central Power Purchasing Generation Company (CPGCL).
Earlier on March 31, the Power Division in a letter to the CPGCL CEO said that it was categorically established that M/s GE has been grossly negligent under the contractual service agreement and therefore primarily responsible for the accident and consequent loses.
“The CPGCL, under close supervision of the GHCL must approach M/s GE to compensate for the loss of around Rs10.8bn plus cost of repair and maintenance involved in restoration of the Unit GT-14. If GE doesn’t compensate the above mentioned losses, the CPGCL under close supervision of the GHCL must legally and prudently evaluate options of black listing such services of M/s GE and referring the matter to NAB/FIA after consideration and approval of the BoDs of the CPGCL and GHCL,” the Power Division’s March 31 letter desired.
The division further asked the CPGCL CEO to complete proceedings against the then chief engineer and plant manager with exemplary punishment under rules and ensure that the necessary SOPs are put in place and proceedings for adequate insurance cover for the plant are completed.
In another letter on March 31, the division sought, in the light of inquiry report, suspension of the GHCL’s CEO with immediate effect. It also sought initiate an inquiry against the GHCL CEO for failing to supervise the operations at CPGCL since COD of the plant and then failure to get necessary actions like proper inquiry, claim with GE etc in place resulting in possible loss to the public sector plant.
“The GHCL is also required to immediately take stock of operations at all Gencos to identify shortcomings and get the deficiencies removed to secure plants from eventualities,” read the letter.
In another letter on March 31, the ministry also reprimanded the CPGCL’s BoD for completing the inquiry after a long period of one year or so. “Regarding failure of the BOD of the CPGCL to get necessary and adequate inquiry conducted immediately, which has been done now after a year from the incident, the board is required to explain why it may not be replaced,” the letter deplored.
