0,UK minister under new attack despite wife’s tax U-turn,"Finance minister Rishi Sunak's wealthy wife Akshata Murty says she will start paying UK tax on  ""all worldwide income"".","LONDON: Britain’s embattled finance minister Rishi Sunak stood accused on Saturday of political hypocrisy as new questions emerged over offshore tax havens reportedly held by his Indian wife.
Sunak was also criticised for a lack of transparency, after he admitted to holding a  “Green Card” for US permanent residents until last year.
Sunak’s wealthy wife Akshata Murty said she would start paying UK tax on  “all worldwide income”, in a bid to defuse a controversy that has further imperilled his waning political fortunes.
But Labour frontbench MP Louise Haigh told BBC radio that Sunak had  “come out on a number of occasions to try and muddy the waters” around his family’s tax affairs.
She conceded that the  “non-domicile” status enjoyed by Murty — shielding the overseas income from her family’s company Infosys against UK taxes — was legal.
But Haigh queried  “whether it was right that the chancellor of the exchequer, whilst piling on 15 separate tax rises to the British public, was benefiting from a tax scheme that allowed his household to pay significantly less to the tune of potentially tens of millions of pounds.” 
The Independent newspaper reported that Sunak was listed as the beneficiary of trusts set up in the British Virgin Islands and Cayman Islands to help manage his wife’s tax and business affairs.
Sunak was listed in 2020, after he became chancellor and after a prior stint as chief secretary to the Treasury, the newspaper said.
“No-one in Akshata’s family is aware of this alleged trust,” a spokeswoman close to the Sunak family said in response.
As chancellor, Sunak oversaw a huge programme of government spending during the coronavirus pandemic, but is now tightening the belt just as Britons face the worst cost-of-living crisis in generations.
Once a leading contender to succeed Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Sunak has seen his popularity plummet in recent weeks as a result, and has accused critics of mounting a  “smear” campaign against his wife.
Allies of the finance minister have told newspapers that Johnson’s office is waging a political hit job.
They said the prime minister believed Sunak had not backed him strongly enough during an ongoing scandal into Downing Street lockdown parties.
Johnson denied knowledge of any briefing operation against Sunak, and told reporters that his chancellor was doing an  “absolutely outstanding job”.
The White House meanwhile declined to comment about Sunak’s Green Card, which the minister said he only gave up ahead of his first visit to the United States as chancellor in October last year.
Under US law, possession of the card meant that Sunak intended to live in America and pay US taxes, despite serving as Britain’s second-most powerful politician.
Sunak and Murty met as students in the United States and they married in 2009. She is the daughter of Indian billionaire N. R. Narayana Murthy, co-founder of the IT giant Infosys.

1,Ukraine urges civilians to flee from eastern region,Boris Johnson visits Kyiv after deadly railway station attack.,"LVIV: Ukraine  on Saturday called on civilians in the eastern Luhansk region to flee  from amassing Russian forces after officials said more than 50 civilians  trying to evacuate by rail from a neighbouring region were killed in a  missile attack the previous day.
Air-raid sirens sounded in cities  across eastern Ukraine, which has become the focus of Russian military  action in recent weeks following a withdrawal from areas close to Kyiv.
“They  are amassing forces for an offensive,” Luhansk Governor Serhiy Gaidai  in a televised address in which he urged remaining civilians to flee  shelling that he said had intensified in recent days.
Russia’s  invasion, which began on Feb 24, has forced more than 4 million people  to flee abroad, killed or injured thousands, left a quarter of the  population homeless, and turned cities into rubble.

Johnson visits Kyiv after deadly railway station attack

The civilian  casualties have triggered a wave of international condemnation, in  particular over the deaths in the town of Bucha, which was until last  week occupied by Russian forces.
Russia has denied targetting  civilians in what it calls a  “special operation” to demilitarise and   “denazify” its southern neighbour. Ukraine and Western nations have  dismissed this as a baseless pretext for war.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson paid an unannounced visit to Kyiv on Saturday in a  “show of solidarity” with Ukraine a day after a missile strike killed dozens at a railway station in the country’s east.
Johnson tweeted that Britain was  “setting out a new package of financial and military aid which is a testament of our commitment to his country’s struggle against Russia’s barbaric campaign”.
As part of the solidarity campaign, a global pledging event for Ukrainian refugees raised 10.1 billion euros ($11 billion), European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said in Warsaw.
With thousands killed in fighting and more than 11 million fleeing their homes or the country, Zelensky said the Kramatorsk strike marked a fresh atrocity that required Western action.
“This is another Russian war crime for which everyone involved will be held accountable,” he said in a video message, calling for  “a firm global response to this war crime”.
Zelensky later said he was  “still ready” to continue talks with Russia to resolve the conflict, after talks with visiting Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer.
US President Joe Biden accused Russia of being behind a  “horrific atrocity” in Kramatorsk, the de facto capital of the Ukrainian-controlled Donetsk region, and France condemned the strike as a  “crime against humanity”. Moscow denied responsibility for the rocket attack on Friday morning, which killed 52 people including five children and injured a further 109 victims, according to the latest official count.
The Ukrainian president said the bombing had been reported in Russia before the missiles had even landed and called for more weaponry to counter Moscow’s aggression.
“I am sure that the victory of Ukraine is just a matter of time, and I will do everything to reduce this time,” he added.
Moscow has denied targeting civilians, but growing evidence of atrocities has galvanised Ukraine’s allies in the EU, which has approved an embargo on Russian coal and the closure of its ports to Russian vessels.
The bloc has frozen 30 billion euros in assets from Russian and Belarusian individuals and companies, it said.
It also blacklisted Putin’s two adult daughters and more than 200 others as part of its latest sanctions package, according to an official list.

Odd Roger Enoksen

 
OSLO: Norway’s government announced on Saturday that defence minister Odd Roger Enoksen was resigning following revelations that he had a years-long affair with a much younger woman.
“It is a necessary decision, after what has surfaced in this matter,” Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store told a press conference where he confirmed that he had accepted Enoksen’s resignation.
“I have made several bad choices and judgements, and will give an unreserved apology for the fact that my actions have made life more difficult for others,” Enoksen told news agency NTB earlier on Saturday.
Enoksen started the affair in 2005 when his partner was still an 18-year-old high school student, according to daily VG.
Her class went on a school trip to Norway’s parliament in the capital Oslo and met the Centre Party politician, who was 50 at the time.
After the school trip she and Enoksen started what would become a very close and sexual relationship, VG wrote.
The woman, now in her 30s, detailed their relationship to the newspaper, saying she felt starstruck by Enoksen due to her interest in politics and that he  “used his power and position to get what he wanted”.
According to the woman, they met at least 12 times in Enoksen’s office between late 2006 and 2007 while he was the energy minister, with some of the meetings involving  “sexual acts”.
While Enoksen confirmed to VG that she had visited him in his office and said there might have been some talk of a lewd nature, he denied there was any physical aspect.
He instead claimed they did not become intimate until after he left the government in 2007, and stressed that the relationship was not one  “where I was in a position of power over her”.
Prime Minister Store told reporters that Enoksen had not informed him about the affair before he was appointed defence minister following last year’s general election, adding the information would have led to a  “different conclusion”.
Store added that he wished to find a new defence minister as soon as possible.

3,US warns of ‘arbitrary’ Covid measures in China,Says it will let some staff leave its Shanghai consulate amid a surge of infections in the locked-down megacity.,"SHANGHAI: The United States on Saturday warned of  “arbitrary” Covid-19 measures in China and said it would let some staff leave its Shanghai consulate amid a surge of infections in the locked-down megacity.
Until March, China had kept cases low with snap lockdowns, mass testing and travel restrictions, but more than 100,000 cases have been reported in Shanghai since March in a test of the country’s strict zero-Covid policy.
The city’s roughly 25 million inhabitants were locked down in phases last week, prompting complaints of food shortages and viral videos of disgruntled residents scuffling with officials.
The US State Department will now allow non-essential employees to leave its consulate in Shanghai  “due to a surge in Covid-19 cases and the impact of restrictions related to the response”, a US embassy spokesperson said in a statement.
The statement warned citizens to reconsider travelling to China,  “due to arbitrary enforcement of local laws and Covid-19-related restrictions”, adding that the embassy in Beijing had raised its concerns over the measures with the Chinese government.
Shanghai reported more than 23,000 new infections on Saturday — mostly asymptomatic, accounting for more than 90 percent of new domestic infections in the country.
City authorities have prepared thousands of new beds in more than 100 makeshift hospitals, Shanghai’s vice mayor Zong Ming said during a press conference on Saturday.
The largest of these, a 50,000-bed hospital in the landmark National Exhibition and Convention Center, opened on Saturday according to state news agency Xinhua.
As part of China’s zero-Covid policy, authorities are insisting on isolating every person who tests positive in hospital wards — which have left existing facilities overrun with patients, even if they show no severe symptoms.
Meanwhile locals have begun to chafe at lockdown restrictions, with many taking to social media to complain of food shortages and express outrage over the recent killing of a pet corgi by health workers, for fear of being infected.
An unpopular policy of separating infected children from their virus-free parents was softened this week after triggering public anger.
But Beijing is sticking to its zero-tolerance approach and is determined to squash the Shanghai outbreak, sending medical workers from around the country in as reinforcements.

The 52-year-old posted video of herself appearing emotional and admiring a green ring in her newsletter,  “On The JLo.” Her representatives then confirmed the engagement announcement to People magazine.
US media reported that the ring was an emerald-cut pale green diamond.
“Bennifer” — the couple’s nickname from their first highly publicized relationship — set the internet alight last year when photos of them together again began circulating.
The pair first met on the set of the widely panned movie  “Gigli” in 2002.
They postponed their planned 2003 nuptials, then announced their relationship was over in early 2004.
It will be the fourth marriage for Lopez and the second for actor and director Affleck, who is 49.
Lopez was previously married to actor Ojani Noa, dancer Cris Judd and singer Marc Anthony, with whom she shares 14-year-old twins Max and Emme.
Affleck was married to actress Jennifer Garner and they are the parents of Violet, 16, Seraphina, 13, and Samuel, 10.
Lopez discussed her renewed relationship with Affleck in an interview with People in February. “It’s a beautiful love story that we got a second chance,” she said.

5,One dead as Israeli army raids W. Bank after attacks,JENIN: Israeli security forces raided the flashpoint West Bank district of Jenin on Saturday killing a Palestinian...,"JENIN: Israeli security forces raided the flashpoint West Bank district of Jenin on Saturday killing a Palestinian and wounding 12 others, after vowing there will  “not be limits” to curb surging violence.
The operation, which lasted several hours, came after a gunman from Jenin went on a shooting rampage in a popular Tel Aviv nightlife area on Thursday evening, killing three Israelis and wounding more than a dozen others.
Following the attack, Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett gave security agencies  “full freedom” to end deadly violence that has surged since March 22  “in order to defeat terror”. “There are not and will not be limits for this war,” Bennett.
On Saturday, the army said security forces had launched the operation in the city of Jenin, in the north of the occupied West Bank, its Palestinian refugee camp and adjacent villages.
The Palestinian health ministry said that at least one Palestinian man was killed by Israeli gunfire, while the Red Crescent said 12 others were wounded.
Crowds of mourners marched through the streets carrying the body of the man — identified by Palestinian officials as 25-year-old Ahmad al-Saadi — on a stretcher covered with the flag of the Gaza Strip-based militant group Islamic Jihad.
‘Armed assailants’
Palestinian security sources said part of Saturday’s operation was to identify the home of the Tel Aviv assailant ahead of demolishing it.
Rights activists have repeatedly denounced Israel’s policy of destroying the homes of Palestinian attackers as collective punishment, while Israel says it acts as a deterrent.
Israeli soldiers and border police forces were  “conducting counterterrorism activity” in the city of Jen­in and its refugee camp, when gunmen had opened fire  “endangering their lives,” the army said in a statement.
In response, troops opened fire  “towards the armed assailants,” the army said, adding there were no injuries among Israeli ranks. “An M16 assault rifle used by an assailant to attack the troops was confiscated,” it added. A photographer at the scene said the operation ended at midday.
The Jenin refugee camp is a stronghold of armed factions, where three other Palestinians linked to an anti-Israeli attack were killed by the army last week.
Saturday’s raid comes a day after Israel said it had killed Raad Hazem, 28, the alleged Tel Aviv attacker.
In addition to giving security forces a free rein to curb a surge in violence, Bennett on Friday ordered the closure of the Jalameh checkpoint between the Jenin area and Israel.
On Friday, the father of the Tel Aviv attacker, Fathi Hazem — a retired Palestinian security forces officer according to Palestinian sources — struck a defiant tone.
Speaking to hundreds at the family home in Jenin, he said the Palestinian people were looking for  “freedom and independence”.
A total of 14 people have been killed in attacks in Israel since March 22, including some carried out by assailants linked to or inspired by the militant Islamic State group. Over the same period, at least 10 Palestinians have been killed, including assailants. The Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas and the Islamic Jihad group praised the Tel Aviv attack — drawing criticism from the UN — but did not claim responsibility.

The migrants were all from sub-Saharan Africa and had set off in two boats, said Mourad Turki, spokesman for the court in the Mediterranean port city of Sfax.
Rescuers pulled 37 migrants from the water on Friday and Saturday but a dozen more remained unaccounted for, he said.
Tunisia and neighbouring Libya are key departure points for migrants seeking to reach European shores, often in vessels that are barely seaworthy.
The United Nations’ refugee agency UNHCR has said that around 1,300 migrants drowned or went missing in the central Mediterranean in 2021, making it the world’s deadliest migration route.
The International Organisation for Migration estimates that more than 18,000 migrants have died or disappeared while attempting to make the crossing since 2014.

7,Thieves steal 60-foot iron bridge in India,Police say thieves pulled off the heist by pretending to be irrigation officials.,"PATNA: A gang of crafty scrap metal thieves dismantled and decamped with a 500-tonne defunct iron bridge in eastern India, police said on Saturday, pulling off the unlikely heist by pretending to be irrigation officials.
The robbing of the bridge was reported on Wednesday in the state of Bihar, one of the poorest in the country.
Police officer Subhash Kumar said the thieves came in the guise of government irrigation officials.
They brought bulldozers and gas cutters and tore apart the structure before escaping with the booty over two days, Kumar said.
“They took away the scrap in a heavy vehicle,” he said. The thieves had been chipping away at the 50-year-old structure — built over a water canal — ever since another bridge nearby was opened to the public five years ago.
Police launched an investigation into the bizarre incident on Thursday but no arrests have been made so far.

8,Iran won’t retreat from ‘nuclear rights’: Raisi,Reiterates Iran's stand that its nuclear programme is solely for peaceful purposes.,"DUBAI: Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi said on Saturday Tehran would not give up its right to develop its nuclear industry for peaceful purposes, and all parties involved in talks to revive the 2015 nuclear accord should respect this.
Eleven months of indirect talks between Iran and the United States in Vienna have stalled as both sides say political decisions are required by Tehran and Washington to settle the remaining issues.
“For more than the one-hundredth time, our message from Tehran to Vienna is that we will not back off from the Iranian people’s nuclear rights... not even an iota,” state media quoted Raisi as saying in a speech marking Iran’s Nuclear Technology Day. Raisi reiterated Iran’s stand that its nuclear programme is solely for peaceful purposes.
The United States is considering removing Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) from its foreign terrorist organisations (FTO) blacklist in return for Iranian assurances about reining in the elite force, Iranian and Western sources had said.
A senior administration official said President Joe Biden did not intend to remove the group from the terrorism designation, Washington Post columnist David Ignatius, who specialises in intelligence matters, reported on Friday.
One Iranian diplomat told Reuters that Tehran had rejected a US proposal to overcome the sticking point by keeping the IRGCs overseas arm, the Quds Force, under FTO sanctions, while delisting the IRGC as an entity.

“Following the publication of a video on the internet of three girls dancing in the cemetery of the martyrs of Neyshabur in Razavi Khorasan province, the prosecutor ordered the identification and arrest of the defendants,” the Tasnim news agency reported.
“The emotions of the families of the martyrs were hurt”, prosecutor Mohammad Hosseini said, adding that the three women had been arrested.
The trio expressed  “remorse and apologies for committing an act against social norms”, he added.
Dancing in Iran is not a crime, but legal experts say that if some someone dances in public or on the internet in a manner seen as offending public decency, they can face prosecution.
