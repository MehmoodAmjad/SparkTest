0,Mulder’s three-wicket burst sends Bangladesh tumbling against South Africa,All-rounder Wiaan Mulder took three wickets in quick succession.,"GQEBERHA: All-rounder Wiaan Mulder took three wickets in quick succession to put South Africa on top on the second day of the second Test against Bangladesh at St George’s Park on Saturday. 
Bangladesh limped to 139 for five at the close, still 314 runs behind their hosts total of 453 all out and their first aim will be to avoid the follow-on when Mushfiqur Rahim (30 not out) and Yasir Ali (8 not out) resume on the third morning. 
Bangladesh lost a wicket in the first over of their reply when first Test century-maker Mahmudul Hasan was caught at first slip off Duanne Olivier for nought. 
Tamim Iqbal and Najmul Hossain put on 79 for the second wicket, scoring at nearly four runs an over, before the medium-paced Mulder came into the attack. 
He dismissed Tamim (47), Najmul (33) and captain Mominul Haque (6) in almost identical fashion. 
Bowling around the wicket, he angled the ball into the three left-handers and trapped them leg before wicket. 
At one stage he had three wickets for five runs in five overs. He finished the day with 3-15. 
Olivier came back into the attack and bowled the dangerous Litton Das (11) with a superb delivery that knocked over middle stump. 
South Africa, who lead 1-0 in the series following a 220-run victory in Durban, had resumed their first innings on 278 for five having won the toss. 
Keshav Maharaj, man of the match for his bowling in the first Test, top-scored for South Africa with a career-best 84. 
He hit his runs off 95 balls with nine fours and three sixes before he was bowled following an ugly swipe across the line off the bowling of left-arm spinner Taijul Islam, who took six for 135 -- the 10th time he has taken five wickets or more in a Test innings. 
Maharaj came in after Kyle Verreynne was bowled for 22 by Khaled Ahmed and almost immediately went on the attack, being severe on fellow left-arm spinner Taijul, whose first ball of the day was hit for six. 
Taijul, Bangladesh’s best bowler on the first day, conceded 27 runs in six overs before switching ends and bowling Mulder for 33. 
He finally bowled Maharaj and also had Simon Harmer smartly stumped for 29 by wicketkeeper Das.

1,Yuzvendra Chahal says IPL team-mate dangled him from 15th-floor balcony,Former India all-rounder and coach Ravi Shastri says the incident must not be taken lightly.,"NEW DELHI: Indian bowler Yuzvendra Chahal says he was dangled from a 15th-floor hotel balcony by a heavily drunk fellow player during the Indian Premier League in 2013. 
The incident happened during a get-together when the leg-spinner, who has played 61 One-day Internationals for India, was a part of the Mumbai Indians franchise. 
Chahal previously alleged that he was also bullied by Mumbai team-mates in 2011 when he was an up-and-coming talent. 
“We had a match in Bengaluru and there was a get-together after that,” Chahal, now 31, said in a video posted Thursday by his current IPL team Rajasthan Royals.  

 





 
“So there was a player who was very drunk — and I won’t take his name — he was very drunk, he just called me aside and he took me outside and he hung me out from the balcony.” 
“I was holding on to him, with my arms around his neck. If I had lost my grip, we were on the 15th floor... had there been a small mistake there, I would have fallen down.” 
Chahal said he was saved by people who rushed to his rescue. 
“Suddenly many people who were there came and handled the situation. I kind of fainted and they gave me water. Then I realised how responsible we need to be when we go anywhere,” said the bowler, who was chatting in the video to fellow spinner Ravichandran Ashwin about tricky off-field situations. 
Former India all-rounder and coach Ravi Shastri said the incident must not be taken lightly, and called for players to be banned from the game if they commit such an offence. 
Shastri, who was in charge of the men’s national team from mid-2017 until last year’s T20 World Cup, said the incident was  “not acceptable”. 
“Someone’s life is at risk, some people might think it is funny but for me, it is not funny at all,” he said during ESPNcricinfo’s ‘T20 Time Out’ programme. “It shows the person who is trying to do it is in a state ... which is not appropriate. 
“If such an incident happens today, [give] a life ban for that person involved and send that person to a rehab centre as quickly as possible. Let him not come near a cricket field again.” 
The IPL and the Mumbai Indians franchise did not respond to requests for comment. 
Former India opening batter Virender Sehwag asked Chahal to reveal the name of the player, saying in a tweet that it was “important to know what happened and what action was taken considering the seriousness of this”. 
Chahal had alleged in a podcast earlier this year that, in another incident, his then Mumbai team-mates James Franklin and Andrew Symonds tied him up, taped his mouth, forgot about him and left him in a room for an entire night after a party in 2011.

2,Everton beat toothless United as Chelsea run riot,"""I have ambitions for this club to stay up, but in the position we are in, fighting comes first and foremost,"" Lampard says.","LONDON: Relegation-threatened Everton earned a priceless win against misfiring Manchester United on Saturday as Chelsea hammered Southampton 6-0 on a potentially decisive day in the race for the Premier League top four. 
Arsenal stumbled again, losing 2-1 against Brighton & Hove Albion while Leeds United pulled further away from the drop zone with an emphatic 3-0 win against struggling Watford. 
Frank Lampard has struggled to inspire Everton since taking over from the sacked Rafael Benitez in late January, winning just two of his nine league games before United’s visit. 
A 3-2 defeat in midweek against Burnley left the club just one point above their relegation rivals and desperately short of confidence. 
But goalkeeper Jordan Pickford made two fine saves to deny Marcus Rashford in the early stages in the spring sunshine at Goodison Park. 
The decisive moment in the 1-0 win came midway through the first half when young forward Anthony Gordon hit a shot that took a huge deflection off England defender Harry Maguire and wrong-footed David de Gea in the United goal. 
The visitors — with top-scorer Cristiano Ronaldo back in the team — huffed and puffed but looked toothless in attack and slipped to an eighth league defeat of the season. 
Lampard said he was proud of his battling side, who are trying to maintain Everton’s proud record of being ever-present in the English top flight since 1954. 
“Beautiful football can come later on,” the former Chelsea boss told BT Sport. “I have ambitions for this club to stay up, play well, but in the position we are in, fighting comes first and foremost.” 
Interim United manager Ralf Rangnick was glum after his side’s latest reverse — they remain in seventh place, three points behind fourth-placed Tottenham Hotspur. 
United, who finished second last season, have won just 47 percent of their Premier League games under the German, their lowest win rate under any manager in the competition. 
Rangnick, who has a two-year contract to remain as a consultant at United beyond this season, was asked whether speculation over the club’s next manager was creating a state of limbo. 
“I don’t think this should be an excuse for anybody,” he said, with Ajax boss Erik ten Hag a strong favourite to be the next permanent boss. 
“We’re Manchester United, we’ve got a lot of international players. This cannot be an alibi for anybody. If the next manager is announced in 10, 14, 21 days, this should not affect a game like today.” 
Third-placed Chelsea suffered a shock 4-1 defeat at the hands of Brentford last week before losing 3-1 against Real Madrid in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final. 
But they restored confidence on Saturday by putting Southampton to the sword, racing into a 4-0 lead with just half an hour played. 
Goals from Marcos Alonso, Mason Mount, Timo Werner and Kai Havertz put the game beyond the home side’s reach by half-time. 
Werner and Mount both scored again early in the second half as the match became an embarrassing rout. 
Arsenal are having a wobble at the wrong time after putting themselves in a strong position to qualify to play in the Champions League for the first time since 2016/17. 
The home defeat against Brighton means Mikel Arteta’s men have now lost three of their past four league games and they are now level with fierce rivals Tottenham, having played the same number of games. 
Brighton took the lead at the Emirates Stadium when Leandro Trossard turned home a low cross from Enock Mwepu while the Zambian midfielder himself added a second. Martin Odegaard scored a late consolation. 
Raphinha, Rodrigo and Jack Harrison all found the net to give Leeds a third win in four matches and take them nine points clear of the relegation zone. 
On Friday, Newcastle United moved a comfortable 10 points clear of the relegation spots with a deserved 1-0 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers thanks to a first goal in front of home fans for striker Chris Wood. 
With the hosts dominating a surprisingly toothless Wolves, New Zealander Woods cleverly drew a foul from goalkeeper Jose Sa as he chased a Joelinton pass, before confidently thumping home the spot kick in the 72nd minute. 
On Sunday, Manchester City and Liverpool go head to head at the Etihad in a top-of-the-table clash that could decide the outcome of the Premier League.

3,Scheffler in charge as Woods bids for Masters miracle,AUGUSTA: World number one Scottie Scheffler took a commanding five- shot lead into the Masters third round on...,"

SCOTTIE Scheffler of the US looks at his birdie putt on the 15th green during the second round of the Masters.—Reuters

 
AUGUSTA: World number one Scottie Scheffler took a commanding five- shot lead into the Masters third round on Saturday while Tiger Woods faces yet another challenge in his comeback from a car crash that nearly cost him his right leg. 
Canada’s Mackenzie Hughes and Australia’s Adam Scott got play started under sunny skies at 1020am ET (1420 GMT) but in unusually cool conditions with temperatures barely breaking into the 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 Celsius). 
The cold represents another hurdle for Woods who is playing his first competitive event in 508 days and sits nine behind Scheffler but confident he is still in the chase for what would be a record-equalling sixth Green Jacket. 
Having had to contend with Augusta National’s undulating layout and severe winds on Friday, the 46-year-old Woods’s damaged leg will now be put to the test by the cold. 
The 15-times major winner and playing partner Kevin Kisner were scheduled to tee off at 1pm ET (1700 GMT). 
“I’m four shots back at second,” said Woods after a battling two-over 74 on Friday. “That’s the thing. It’s going to be windy. It’s going to be cool. It’s going to be the Masters that I think the Masters Committee has been looking forward to for a number of years.” 
It is not just Woods who needs to mount one of his famous Saturday charges if Scheffler, the hottest golfer on the planet with three PGA Tour wins in his last five starts, is to be reeled in. 
The 25-year-old American, even with a five-stroke cushion, cannot afford to get complacent being chased by trio of major winners including South Africa’s Charl Schwartzel, the 2011 winner at Augusta National, Irishman Shane Lowry the 2019 British Open winner, and defending Masters champion Hideki Matsuyama of Japan. 
Also five back is South Korea’s Im Sung-jae , the first round overnight leader. 
Matsuyama is trying to join Jack Nicklaus, Nick Faldo and Woods as the only players to win back-to-back Masters. 
But everyone is chasing Scheffler, who has the lead in a major championship for the first time. 
Scheffler insisted his commanding lead was not a source of pressure. 
“If anything, it gives me more confidence,” said Scheffler, who was to tee of at 2:50pm ET (1850) alongside Schwartzel. “As long as I’m committed to everything, everything should be fine. The rest really isn’t up to me.”

4,Former England head coach Silverwood takes Sri Lanka role,COLOMBO: Sri Lanka Cricket on Saturday appointed former England head coach Chris Silverwood to manage the ...,"COLOMBO: Sri Lanka Cricket on Saturday appointed former England head coach Chris Silverwood to manage the country’s national team, replacing stand-in Rumesh Ratnayake. 
The 47-year-old’s first assignment will be training his new team for the upcoming tour of Bangladesh, SLC said in a statement. 
“He is an experienced coach and from our discussions...it is clear he has the required qualities we are looking for to take the team forward,” SLC Chief Ashley de Silva said. 
Silverwood served as England’s head coach from late 2019 till early 2022, stepping down after a disastrous Ashes campaign that saw his team lose 4-0. 
He was England’s bowling coach when the team won the 2019 ICC World Cup. 
Sri Lanka has been without a full-time head coach since South African Mickey Arthur stepped down late last year. Former Test player Ratnayake was named interim coach in January ahead of tours of Zimbabwe and Australia. 
“I am very excited to be on board with Sri Lanka and I cannot wait to get over to Colombo and get started,” Silverwood said in an SLC statement. 
“They have a talented and passi­onate group of players and I am really looking forward to meeting up with the players and coaching staff very soon.”

5,Leclerc puts Ferrari on pole at Australian GP,MELBOURNE: Charles Leclerc took pole position for Ferrari in crash-laden qualifying for the Australian Grand Prix on...,"MELBOURNE: Charles Leclerc took pole position for Ferrari in crash-laden qualifying for the Australian Grand Prix on Saturday, pipping Red Bull’s world champion Max Verstappen on the upgraded Albert Park circuit. 
Leclerc saved his best for last, his flying lap of one minute 17.868 seconds nearly three-tenths of a second quicker than Verstappen, leaving the Dutchman in a funk over the performance of his RB18 car. 
Verstappen finished ahead of third-quickest team mate Sergio Perez, with McLaren’s Lando Norris to start fourth on the grid. 
Leclerc’s 11th career pole and second of the season set up another Sunday showdown with Verstappen, the pair’s rivalry having dominated the early races. 
The Ferrari driver was summoned by the stewards for “driving unnecessarily slowly” on an in-lap but no action was taken. Leclerc and the team explained that the lap was meant to be a cool-down lap and not an in-lap before they changed their mind. 
Perez’s grid position was in some doubt after he was summoned for allegedly failing to slow down when a yellow flag came out, but the stewards reviewed the evidence and concluded that he was in the clear. 
Seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton, whose run of six consecutive poles at Albert Park was broken, will start fifth ahead of sixth-placed team mate George Russell in an encouraging session for Mercedes, who have struggled this season with a bouncy car. 
However, they may end up battling McLaren to be the “best of the rest” after Ferrari and Red Bull. 
McLaren’s home hero Daniel Ricciardo will start seventh on the grid. Esteban Ocon in an Alpine was eighth and Carlos Sainz in the other Ferrari ninth. 
Veteran Fernando Alonso, who has been quick all weekend in the Alpine, had to settle for 10th after crashing at Turn 11, saying on the radio he couldn’t shift down gears. 
It was a dismal day for four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel, who sent his Aston Martin into a wall in the final practice and managed just three laps in qualifying. 
He finished 18th to cap a miserable time for the German, who missed the opening two races of the year with Covid, suffered engine failure on Friday and was fined 5,000 euros (US$5,437) after riding a moped on the track. 
His team-mate Lance Stroll also endured a tough day. After crashing in third practice, his crew patched up the car and got him out with four minutes left of Q1. 
But before he completed a lap, he and Nicholas Latifi got tangled up, leaving debris from the Canadian’s Williams strewn on the track.

Julen Lopetegui’s side had looked ready to settle for a point after Granada captain Victor Diaz levelled 2-2 for the visitors with two minutes to go in the Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan Stadium.
But in a late flurry Mir grabbed the his team’s third goal three minutes into injury time with Gomez adding a fourth six minutes later.
After losing last weekend to their direct rivals Barca, Sevilla now have 60 points, three ahead of both the Catalans who have played two games fewer, and Atletico Madrid.
On Friday, Granada started brightly with Darwin Machis scoring after 23 minutes as his side looked to move clear of the relegation zone.
But Diego Carlos pulled Sevilla back eight minutes later getting his head to a Jesus Navas cross.
Lucas Ocampos bundled in for the hosts after 66 minutes following a poor clearance from Granada keeper Luis Maximiano.
Mir had a goal ruled out after a VAR review before Diaz rekindled Granada hopes with a powerful header off a corner.
Sevilla made the most of nine minutes of time added on with Ivan Rakitic setting up Mir, unmarked at the far post, for the key third goal.
Sevilla achieved just their third win in their last 11 games and move nine points behind leaders Real Madrid.

PFB president Syed Fakhar Ali Shah on Saturday said he had sent a reminder to PSB director general retired Col Asif Zaman for holding the camp as Pakistan had directly qualified for the Asian Games on the basis of their ranking at the Asian level which was fifth. Top six countries will be featuring in the Asian Games baseball event.
Fakhar said he had written a letter to the DG on March 15, 2022 but so far had not receive any response from him in this regard.
The Asian Games are scheduled to be held in Hangzhou, China from Sept 10 to 25 this year, soon after the end of the Commonwealth Games being organised in Birmingham from July 28 to Aug 8.
According to Fakhar, the PSB had set up training camps for other sports  but no such decision had been taken for baseball yet.
Fakhar hoped the PSB would soon approve a camp for baseball too.
“Pakistan have to prepare a strong team since world’s top three teams namely Olympic champions Japan, world No.2 Taiwan and world No.3 South Korea will be in action at Hangzhou,” he stated.
Through the PFB hard work, Fakhar insisted, had lifted Pakistan to fifth spot in Asia, adding the country was 26th in the world rankings.

The second-placed Ruhr valley club, who have five games left in the season, maintained their slim title chances as they are on 60 points, six behind Bayern Munich, who have a game in hand. 
Dortmund, who had lost 4-1 at home against Leipzig last week, suffered some bad luck at the start with Gio Reyna being taken off injured after only two minutes and Brandt coming on. 
“The best response you can give to setbacks [like defeat to Leipzig] is to win games,” Brandt said. “That’s also what goes down well with fans. Unfortunately we have been forced to show such reactions too often. We need to improve that.” 
The visitors quickly recovered from the early setback with Raphael Guerreiro hitting the post in the ninth minute before Brandt tapped in for the lead from an Erling Haaland pass in the 12th to score the earliest goal by a substitute in Bundesliga history. 
“You try to quickly warm up but team mates have little patience at this stage,” he said of the early substitution. “You are then under pressure to get into the game quickly with the first touches.” 
Norwegian Haaland, a major transfer target, provided the assist but has not scored in his last five league matches, his longest goal drought in the Bundesliga. 
With Stuttgart missing in-form striker Sasa Kalajdzic, they were on the backfoot after the break and Brandt struck again in the 71st. He rifled in from the edge of the box to give Dortmund a two-goal cushion. 
Stuttgart, beaten for the first time in five league games, had a string of late chances but Borna Sosa hit the crossbar and an unmarked Konstantinos Mavropanos sent his header wide.

Bencic and Badosa’s first meeting came one year ago in Charleston, which ended up being Badosa’s maiden Top 20 win. Badosa defeated Bencic twice more since then, but Bencic finally got a win over the Spaniard in her fourth attempt, after two hours and 47 minutes.
For a spot in the final, reigning Olympic gold medalist Bencic will face Ekaterina Alexandrova, who powered past Magda Linette 6-0, 6-2 in just 62 minutes.
The other semi-final will see fourth seed Ons Jabeur of Tunisia pit her wits against 15th-seeded American Amanda Anisimova.
Jabeur eased past Ukraine’s Anhelina Kalinina 6-3, 6-2 while Anisi­mova won the nightcap quarter-final over fellow Amer­ican CoCo Vandeweghe 6-1, 6-2.
