0,Petition of ex-ECP official against FIA probe into disputed appointments dismissed,SHC is told former Sindh election commissioner did not appear before IO...,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court has dismissed a petition of a former provincial election commissioner filed against an inquiry initiated by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) about disputed appointments.
Former Sindh election commissioner Tanveer Zaki moved the SHC questioning a notice issued by an investigating officer (IO) of the FIA last month asking him to appear before him in term of a complaint made by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) regarding disputed appointments made in the office of provincial election commission in Sindh in 2015.
The petitioner made the ministry of law & justice, chief election commissioner, ECP secretary, Sindh election commission and the IO of the FIA as respondents.
While referring to a ruling of the Supreme Court, the counsel for the petitioner argued that no proceedings of any kind could be undertaken against the petitioner after two years of retirement.

SHC is told former Sindh election commissioner did not appear before IO

He further submitted that the petitioner had retired in June 2017 and the impugned notice was issued on March 8, thus the inquiry was illegal and liable to be set aside.
However, a two-judge bench headed by Justice Mohammad Iqbal Kalhoro dismissed the petition for not being maintainable.
The bench in its order stated that when it asked the lawyer whether the petitioner appeared before the IO, he replied in the negative.
It observed that the judgement cited in the defence was an issue of interpretation of Section 21 of the Punjab Employees Efficiently, Discipline and Accountability Act 2006 proviso to which stipulated that departmental proceedings initiated against a retired employee must be finalised no later than two years of his retirement.
It further noted that the departmental and criminal proceedings were independent to each other and detached in terms of substance and consequences.
“The departmental proceedings afford an issue of making a determination regarding alleged misconduct of an employee while performing official duty while criminal proceedings deal with action or omission committed as such which is conceptualised or comprehended as an offence or a contravention punishable under some penal laws for the time being in force over the subject,” it added.
Therefore, the bench said that apparently the judgement of the apex court cited in defence was distinguishable and was not applicable to the case of petitioner for the relief he was seeking vide this petition.
“From what has been stated, no case for indulgence, discretionary in nature, has been made out, particularly, in view of petitioner’s recalcitrance to submit to the course of law enforced through impugned notice. This being the position, we find this petition not maintainable and dismiss it accordingly,” it concluded.

The demonstrators raised vociferous slogans against the influential contractor and said he had left the drainage lines broken in the wake of roads’ construction which had inundated streets and caused sewage to enter into houses. 
The protesters’ leaders Eidan Jagirani, Manzoor Gadani, Saleem Raja and others said that drainage lines and water supply pipelines were being dislodged and at some points they were being broken to carry out construction of roads in the colony. 
They said that they did not oppose construction of streets and road but the contractor had spoiled the good work with his irresponsible and arrogant attitude. “When we ask him to repair the broken drainage lines and water supply lines, he threatens us with dire consequences and says he will get cases registered against us for hindering the constructional work,” said residents. 
The demonstrators said that unless drainage lines and water supply pipelines were repaired immediately, they would continue their protest.

4,Tribunal rejects PTI candidate’s plea for recount of PS-84 votes,HYDERABAD: The Election Tribunal headed by Justice Amjad Ali Sahito of Sindh High Court’s Hyderabad circuit on...,"HYDERABAD: The Election Tribunal headed by Justice Amjad Ali Sahito of Sindh High Court’s Hyderabad circuit on Saturday dismissed the election petition of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) candidate for PS-84 Mehar Sadaqat Ali Jatoi against his Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) rival Fayyaz Butt, who had won the seat in the 2018 general elections.
The tribunal ruled that the petitioner failed to convince it on exercising its powers for a recount of votes.
It said that the allegations levelled by the petitioner appeared to be frivolous, vague and indefinite; and without adequate statements of material facts regarding truth for a recount. 
An order for recounting of votes is given when returning officer considers the request so made as not unreasonable but in the instant matter it is lacking reasons; the application for recount of votes was made after consolidation of result as the order dated July 28, 2018 passed by the returning officer (RO) reflects so, according to the ET ruling.
It ordered that the petitioner must specify allegations of tampering and manipulations etc in very clear terms along with necessary details and prima facie material supporting such allegations as secrecy of ballot should not be violated based on frivolous vague and unfounded allegations; and primary objective should be to do full justice in the matter.
Fayyaz Butt, now a provincial minister, was represented by Ishrat Ali Lohar advocate while Sadaqat Ali Jatoi was represented by Ghulam Sarwar Baloch advocate. 
Mr Jatoi had filed an election petition against the Aug 7, 2018 notification of the PS-84 Mehar results issued by the Provincial Election Commission declaring respondent Fayyaz Butt elected on the seat. 
The petitioner stated that he had obtained 41,091 votes whereas respondent Fayyaz Butt got 42,232 votes with a difference of 1,141 votes.
He stated in his petition that his rival candidate’s party was in government before announcement of elections and had great influence on the interim government.
He said that Dadu district administration and local government (LG) representatives including chairman of Dadu District Council, Mehar Municipal Committee etc all belonged to the PPP and, as such, posting of polling staff was not free from influence.
The polling staff were issued threats of stoppage of their salaries if they did not act in accordance with the instructions of taluka education officer (primary). Since most polling staff, especially presiding officers and assistant presiding officers, were from the education department, they were influenced by the respondent candidate, who wanted to get the results of his choice through rejection of the petitioner’s valid votes.
Mr Jatoi alleged that his polling agents at 42 polling stations were forced to leave by the polling staff. After receiving such information, he said, his chief agent had approached the returning officer concerned but no action was taken.
He said that even at the time of the vote counting process, his polling agents were not allowed to participate. Due to their absence and under influence of the respondent candidate, the polling staff favoured the respondent despite protest by the petitioner’s polling agents. The petitioner’s valid votes were either rejected or counted in favour the of the respondent, he added.
Mr Jatoi also alleged in his petition that in the provisional consolidated results as per the form-47, his obtained votes were shown as 43,252 while the respondent’s votes were put at 42,218 whereas rejected votes were 4,634. As such, the rejected votes were more than the margin between the two candidates’ votes.
He said that as per the RO’s note in the results, 1,226 votes of polling station No. 62, namely Govt Girls High School Betto, had not been included but unofficial results were announced. He pointed out that the RO was in such a haste that he put incorrect date of the issuance of form-47 (June 26, 2018) instead of July 26, 2018.
He alleged that presiding officers had committed grave irregularities and illegalities during counting of votes and without adopting proper procedure of law while issuing form-45 which were neither on prescribed form nor were they signed and stamped.
Mr Jatoi also stated that he had moved an application for recounting or verification of rejected votes which was allowed and the RO had called him and the respondent candidate. The election agents carried out rechecking and recounting of rejected votes polled at two polling stations and it was found that there were 20 to 25 rejected votes of the petitioner. Despite the petitioner’s request for inclusion of the same as valid, the RO did not accept the plea and extended favour to the respondent, he said.
Mr Jatoi’s counsel said his client’s petition was maintainable as all requisite provisions of the 2017 Act were complied with. He said the petitioner had secured 41,091 votes, excluding his 4,634 stray, spoiled or rejected votes. On being recounted, the number of his client’s votes would have increased to 45,725, i.e more than the respondent’s 42,232 votes, he argued. 
He contended that his client’s votes were rejected by way of rigging and with mala fide intention.
Fayyaz Butt’s counsel Ishrat Lohar rebutted the petitioner’s claims and allegations. He said that no illegality or irregularity was committed by his client. 
The entire polling process was conducted peacefully except in the petitioner’s home polling station where, according to the counsel, the petitioner and his supporters took over the polling station for rigging. An FIR to this effect was lodged and a re-poll was ordered by the Election Commission, he said.

7,Growers hold march against ‘embezzlement of de-silting funds’,DADU: Growers and members of political parties and civil society marched on foot for five kilometres along...,"DADU: Growers and members of political parties and civil society marched on foot for five kilometres along Dadu-Larkana Indus Highway and arrived at Alamdar Chowk in Khairpur Nathan Shah town on Saturday to protest against irrigation department’s failure to carry out de-silting of canals, embezzlement of funds and ‘artificial’ shortage of water in tail-end areas of K.N. Shah and Mehar talukas. 
The protesters led by Amjad Gadehi, Hafiz Hajan Leghari, Lal Bukhsh Shaikh, Shafiq Gadehi and Qatibuddin Buriro said that farmland in the tail-end of Rice Canal, Nara distributary, Kudan Wah, Khuda Wah, Abad Shakh, Kalro Shakh and Nara distributary faced the worst shortage of water, which was mostly artificial. 
Amjad Gadehi said that Rice Canal had been shut in the name of seasonal closure, which had caused the worst water crisis at the tail-end of Rice Canal, Nara distributary, Kudan Wah, Khuda Wah, Abad Shakh, Kalro Shakh, Nara distributary in K.N. Shah and Mehar in Dadu district. 
He said that modules and watercourses were broken at the head of the canal, which had already caused the worst crisis of water in Mehar and K.N. Shah talukas. 
Hafiz Hajan Leghari said that political personalities associated with Pakistan Peoples Party and Sindh government were stealing water at the head of the canal by tampering with modules in collusion with irrigation department’s officials, leading to shortage of water at the tail-end.  
He demanded that all tampered modules should be repaired and water regulation be carried out under Rangers personnel before releasing water into the Rice Canal after seasonal closure. 
He said that no one in the government was ready to stop theft of water at the head of Rice Canal and other waterways because the theft was mostly committed by influential PPP leaders and supporters. 
Lal Bakhsh Shaikh said that local economy depended completely on farming of the land and cultivation of crops and the water shortage in canals during paddy sowing had caused panic among small farmers. 
Shafiq Gadehi said that officials of the irrigation department had misappropriated millions of rupees by filing fake bills of de-silting of Rice Canal and other waterways because de-silting had not been carried out on ground. Heavy silt accumulating for years was a major obstruction to water reaching the till-end areas, he said. 
He said that people of Radhan, Thariri Mohabbat, Nau Goth, Shah Panjo, Mehar, K.N. Shah, Gozo, Kakar, Khanpur were facing the worst shortages of water and they did not even have a single drop of water available in the tail-end areas even for their animals. 
He demanded the Sindh government take serious notice of the situation and provide complete share of water to tail-end growers in K.N. Shah and Mehar talukas.

The kilns had been operating without proper official permission and had received several warning letters from deputy director of environment. 
The complaints filed with the deputy director said that the thick toxic smoke emanating from the brick kilns caused serious inconvenience to teachers and schoolchildren as well as nearby residents of villages.
Deputy director (environment) Sohaib Rajput the department had issued various warning notices to the kiln owners and directed them not to burn filthy garbage and plastic bags, which caused thick and toxic smoke, but they ignored the directives. 
On Saturday, Shujaabad taluka assistant commissioner Mohammad Saleem Shaikh along with deputy director Sohaib Rajput and other staff paid a visit to the brick kilns, including Hakim Ali bricks, Ghulam Shabbir bricks, Tarique Ali bricks and Mashooque bricks and ordered their owners to immediately close them. 
The team found filth thrown out by poultry farms at two brick kilns which was being used a fuel and led to increase in pollution. 
Shujaabad taluka assistant commissioner had directed owners of brick kilns to submit their environment management plan to government under the environmental law. He asked to stop immediately burning of substandard materials in the kilns to keep the atmosphere clean.

9,MQM-P vows to make a comeback in next election,"Accuses PTI, its former coalition partner, of betrayal.","KARACHI: The Mutta­hida Qaumi Movement Pakistan (MQM-P) has organised a rally in support of the recent verdict of the apex court that restored the National Assembly and vowed to make a comeback in the next general elections.
A large number of MQM workers and supporters, including women and children, took out small rallies from different parts of the city and converged at the Ayesha Manzil traffic intersection in Federal B Area late on Saturday night. 
Chanting slogans and dancing to the tunes of party songs, the MQM-P worker were full of praise for the Supreme Court that had declared the ruling of the deputy speaker and subsequent dissolution of the National Assembly illegal.
The party said it had accepted the results of 2018 general elections despite the fact that its mandate was forcibly “snatched” and it waited for more than three years for justice with the people of urban Sindh.
Accusing its former coalition partner Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf of betrayal, the party leaders believed that the decision to part ways with the federal government proved that MQM-P took a right path, as otherwise it would have been counted among those who defied the Constitution. 
Speaking to the participants of the rally, MQM leader Amir Khan said that “all experiments” had failed and each one of them had proved that only MQM-P was the true representative of Karachi and its people.
“We tried to convince everyone but our argument was labelled as ethnic one,” he said. “It’s not the ethnicity. We are true representatives of Karachi and its people regardless of their ethnicity, language, religion, background or culture.”
“When we talk about urban Sindh it means every single person living in urban Sindh regardless of his /her ethnic origin. But it’s better late than never. The national political leadership has finally accepted this demand. They have realised that we [MQM-P] are right. And it’s all because of your [workers] patience and sacrifices,” he said.
He also questioned the Jamaat-i-Islami and Pak Sarzameen Party (PSP) for criticising MQM-P’s deal with the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP).
He asked the leaders of the two parties as to why they were criticising the MQM-P when they already had made similar agreements with the same party that has been ruling the province for the past 14 years.
“I wonder how the Jamaat-i-Islami and PSP are criticising us for signing a pact with the PPP when they had already done the same,” said Mr Khan. “They had celebrated and offered prayers when the PPP had agreed to shake hands with them. Now they are criticising us.”
He said their criticism was only because they knew they would get no seats in the election if the MQM-P was given its due political space in the city.

10,Police seek hi-tech scanners to check vehicles carrying explosives,"For Karachi, law-enforcers recommend 10 scanners to randomly check movement of armed persons.","KARACHI: In a fresh development, the Sindh police have sought support from the provincial government to acquire modern and high-tech vehicle scanners for exit and entry points of the province and key spots across Karachi to keep a check on suspicious vehicles carrying arms and explosives entering and leaving the city. 
The proposal is also designed to modernise the concept of snap-checking in urban policing that usually cause nuisance to road users, a top official told Dawn on Saturday. 
The plan has been forwarded to the finance department of the province and the law enforcement agency is now waiting for a final nod. 
The proposal was conceived more than a year ago. It came to light again after the recent surge of crimes in Karachi and reports of movement of snatched vehicles by carjackers carrying arms from the city to other parts of the country. 

For Karachi, law-enforcers recommend 10 scanners to randomly check movement of armed persons

“We have sought installation of modern high-tech vehicle scanners on key exit and entry points of the province and there are some six such points,” the top official added. 
“We also want scanners within Karachi. Those scanners are compact and not of those kinds which are installed or put in place on highways. They are moveable, easy to handle and need only a couple of people to operate. These machines are used for scanning moving vehicles without creating a scene on roads. In Karachi we have proposed at least 10 compact and smart scanners which we can use for checking and snap-checking when required or on any intelligence-based report.” 
The Sindh police sources said that the law enforcement agency for a long time was pleading for scanners to be installed at key points mainly on the city’s exit and entrance and for that they had approached the authorities concerned to get a nod for procurement. 
“The issue came under the spotlight again in June 2020 when the Pakistan Stock Exchange came under an armed attack,” said a source sharing background information of the proposal. “The investigation into the incident showed serious loopholes and a lack of capacity of the police in some areas. One of which was free movement of [the militants in] a vehicle carrying arms, ammunition and explosives within the city.” 
The findings, he said, pushed the police authorities to further build their case for installation of the scanners at key points of the city connecting with other cities of the province and Balochistan. 
“Similarly, it is also proposed that some of the areas within the city should also be covered. Snap-checking following any lead or an intelligence report sometimes causes inconvenience and attracts a strong reaction from the public. The technology can help in this regard,” he added. 
The PSX had come under attack in June 2020 when four heavily armed attackers lobbed grenades at its entrance and opened fire on security guards and officials. The miscreants were killed in an exchange of fire that also claimed the lives of a police officer and three security guards. 
The outlawed Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) had claimed responsibility for the attack. 
“It emerged during the course of the investigation that the armed men had entered the city through regular routes and managed to reach their destination, in the heart of the city, successfully without any trouble. It’s difficult to check every moving vehicle and only technology and modern gadgets can help curtail such crimes and terrorist acts,” said a senior official while confirming the proposal for the procurement of the scanners. 
He said the Sindh police budget had a limited capacity for procurement and the law-enforcement agency had sought support from the provincial government for the high-tech equipment. 
With an increase of over Rs6 billion, the Sindh government in June 2021 allocated Rs119.97bn in the head of law and order in its budget for fiscal year 2021-22 compared to Rs113.87bn allocated in the last fiscal year. 
An amount of Rs3.695bn is allocated for purchase of physical assets for the Sindh police. 
Budget document says, of the amount, Rs2 billion will be for procurement of transport and Rs1.1 billion for arms and ammunition.

13,Death of teenager sparks violence in Korangi,Family alleges Abdullah was tortured to death by policemen; one of three cops at checkpoint commits suicide...,"KARACHI: Violence erupted in a Korangi locality in the small hours of Saturday morning as enraged people set two motorbikes on fire and attacked a police post in protest over the death of a teenage boy who they said was tortured by policemen deputed at a checkpoint for not carrying documents of the motorbike he was riding.
The violent protest prompted higher authorities to intervene into the matter and order an impartial inquiry to ascertain the allegations about the death of 17-year-old Abdullah.
Korangi SSP Faisal Bashir Memon said that Abdullah recently returned home in Ibrahim Hyderi after spending 40 days with Tableeghi Jamaat.
He left his home on Friday at 3pm and was found unconscious on a street near a mosque in Zaman Town’s Tasawar Mahal checkpoint at about 6pm, he said, adding that two people from the mosque informed the checkpoint in charge about the man lying unconscious. The policemen went there and found a cell phone in his pocket. They rang to his mother, who reached the spot along with her brother Yasir. 

Family alleges Abdullah was tortured to death by policemen; one of three cops at checkpoint commits suicide

They took Abdullah to a nearby hospital in Korangi where doctors asked them to take him to the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases. They moved him to the cardio facility, where doctors pronounced him dead on arrival.
The SSP said the family took away the body without completing medico-legal formalities. At around 10.15pm, Yasir, the maternal uncle of the victim, called Madadgar-15 and said Abdullah was ‘tortured to death’ allegedly by the policemen posted at the checkpoint.
He said soon after 100-150 protesters gathered at the Tasawar Mahal Chowki and restored to violence and set two parked motorbikes on fire. 
The SSP said after a considerable time, the police pacified the protesters and convinced the family to take the body to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre for a post-mortem examination.
He said doctors did not find any apparent injury marks on the body.
However, Dr Summaiya Syed, the additional police surgeon of the hospital, said the cause of death was reserved for histopathological and chemical examiner’s report. 
She said the post-mortem examination was carried out in the presence of relatives and police at 2am on Saturday.
The family alleged that that Abdullah had gone to buy Iftar items on a motorbike. He was stopped by the policemen deputed at the checkpoint. As he did not carry with him the bike’s documents, the policemen allegedly took him inside the kiosk and allegedly tortured him.
The SSP said DIG-East Muqaddus Haider ordered an inquiry to ascertain the veracity of the family’s allegations. 
Policeman commits suicide
Later, a policeman, who was present at the checkpoint and called for initial inquiry, committed suicide by shooting himself to death.
The Sharafi Goth police said that Head Constable Mohammad Sajjad, 38, was posted at the Tasawar Mahal police post along with two other policemen when the incident was reported. 
The Korangi SSP said Sajjad and two other policemen were called on Friday night after the incident. He said he appeared to be an “emotional person” and was in “depression”.
He said apparently he ended his life as he feared that he might be implicated in a murder case.

Appearances can often be deceptive. Two beggars at work in DHA.—Fahim Siddiqi  / White Star

 
KARACHI: They don’t advertise for your zakat donations on big panaflex pasted on building walls or billboards, but they are also there making their presence felt in a big way. There are certain rules to begging that all beggars know and that one should also get to know for one’s own good. Whenever one is eating anything, one will find a beggar closer than that morsel of food one is about to put into one’s mouth. Then one needs to give him (or her or them) something to let one eat in peace. It happens more during Ramazan as more beggars descend upon the big city from all parts of the country because, well, it is the time to give. And the bigger the city, the more loaded the citizens and thus ... the bigger the charity. 
But zakat isn’t all that is on the minds of the beggars. Upon arrival, they first need to find for themselves a nice spot for business. The good spots are taken usually. And they don’t come free either. And the best spots are in Clifton and Defence. These days you also find beggars squatting by the roadside in quiet neighbourhood streets in DHA. Perhaps they get such spots for free or perhaps they were afraid to be picked up by the anti-beggary police. 
Then begging alone is not good. You need to have a partner. Beggar women must be accompanied with a child, the younger the better. Hearts don’t melt at seeing them alone. In fact they are viewed indecently when without little children, unless that is the intention. 

New beggars decsend on all areas particularly DHA, Clifton; menace of beggary thrives as the needy and  greedy get muddled up

“My mother is sick, I need to get her medicine, I need to get her food,” begged a young man at Schon Circle in Clifton. When asked to move out of the way, he explained that he was not a beggar he was selling attar, a little bottle of which he brought out of cloth bag that he was carrying. Then why didn’t he say so in the first place instead of talking about his sick mother? Do the attar sellers in the nice big shops in Saddar also make sales starting like this? 
The man selling shalwar and pajama drawstrings, or izarbund, also had a similar sob story to tell, which people didn’t seem too impressed by. That little four- or five-year-old unwashed child next to him was also not gathering much attention near the Ashiana Shopping Mall. 
But that abaya-clad mother with pleading eyes who was with a four-year-old boy and a six-year-old girl sitting on a sidewalk as one entered Zamazama from Do Talwar made one want to turn around to look at them even after passing them by. The little girl was also holding up a placard with all their hardships listed on it. One wondered where the man in the family was only to read soon enough that he was sick and bedridden. 
A little ahead, another mother with a young child by her side and a wailing baby in her arms said that her husband was dead. Two days later the same women could be found at the same spots but somehow the children with them were different although they were of the same size. 
More women and children were found sitting in lines outside small eateries in DHA’s commercial areas, especially the Phase II Commercial Area off Korangi Road where the people who came to eat themselves were paying for their meals. On average every other customer is seen paying for the meals of five or 10 persons. 
Many homes, especially in DHA are marked by the needy (read greedy) for free giveaways, even by those who are new or just visiting here. Some gather outside their gates soon around Iftar time for free food and whatever else that is on offer for free. The gifts become bigger and better as the month moves ahead. Close to Eid the freebies include new clothes and footwear, too. “Yes beggary is a menace, but during Ramazan, we are also looking to help the needy, so they are welcome to come here. We don’t send away anyone empty-handed,” said one person distributing food and gifts to the ‘poor’ gathered outside his home.
