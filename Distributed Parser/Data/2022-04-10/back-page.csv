WASHINGTON: The US State Department has said that there’s “absolutely no truth” in Prime Minister Imran Khan’s claim that Washington is behind an alleged conspiracy to overthrow his government.
Mr Khan has been claiming that his independent foreign policy has annoyed ‘foreign powers’ and they have financed the opposition’s no-trust move against him.
In an address to the nation on Friday, the prime minister reiterated his allegations that a senior US diplomat threatened a regime change in Pakistan.
In another statement, Mr Khan also named the official — Donald Lu, Assistant Secretary, Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs in the Department of State — who allegedly threatened a regime-change in Pakistan during a meeting with the then Pakistani ambassador Asad Majeed Khan.

Official says Washington supports Pakistan’s constitutional process

At a Friday evening news briefing in Washington, a journalist reminded Deputy State Department Spokesperson Jalina Porter that in his address to the nation, Mr Khan renewed his allegation that the US had encouraged the no-confidence vote, saying that he had a diplomatic cable to prove it.
“Let me just say very bluntly there is absolutely no truth to these allegations,” said Ms Porter.
“Of course, we continue to follow these developments, and we respect and support Pakistan’s constitutional process and rule of law. But again, these allegations are absolutely not true,” she added.
A prestigious diplomatic news site, ‘Foreign Policy,’ noted in its latest report on Pakistan that “the future of Islamabad’s fragile relationship with Washington remains foggy after Prime Minister Khan levelled serious allegations against the United States, making it a central part of their political crisis”.
The report, however, argued that Mr Khan’s description of the alleged US involvement sounded more like “a US official complaining about the Pakistani prime minister, not plotting his ousting”.
The Washington-based news site noted that in Pakistan, public mistrust of the United States “runs deep, in great part because there is a history of US meddling in Pakistan’s internal politics”.
The report warned that Mr Khan’s allegations “have hurt US-Pakistan relations, especially after Khan publicly named the US official” involved in the so-called plot.
The report pointed out that their ties were unsettled before this political crisis too “as each country deepens relations with the other’s top rival — Washington with New Delhi and Islamabad with Beijing”.
The report warned that Mr Khan’s allegation of the United States orchestrating regime change “will make it more difficult to rein in the unmoored relationship”.

1,Lankan president faces biggest street protest,"Sri Lanka’s 22 million people have seen weeks of power blackouts and severe shortages of food, fuel and other essentials.","COLOMBO: Tens of thousands marched on beleaguered Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s office on Saturday, in the biggest protest to date over the country’s dire economic and political crisis.
Sri Lanka’s 22 million people have seen weeks of power blackouts and severe shortages of food, fuel and other essentials in the country’s worst downturn since independence in 1948.
Saturday’s social-media organised protest drew the largest numbers since the crisis blew up last month according reporters.
And pressure on Rajapaksa intensified further as the country’s powerful business community also began withdrawing support for the president.
Men and women poured onto Colombo’s seafront promenade and laid siege to the colonial-era Presidential Secretariat, chanting “Go home Gota” and waving the national lion flag.

2,Saudi Arabia to allow 1m Haj pilgrims,Pilgrims must be under age 65 and fully vaccinated against coronavirus.,"RIYADH: Saudi Arabia said on Saturday it will permit one million Muslims from inside and outside the country to participate in this year’s Haj, a sharp uptick after pandemic restrictions forced two years of drastically pared-down pilgrimages.
However, the pilgrimage, which will take place in July, will be limited to Muslims under age 65 and fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, the ministry of Haj and Umrah said in a statement carried by the SPA news agency.
Those coming from outside Saudi Arabia, who must apply for Haj visas, will this year also be required to submit a negative Covid-19 PCR result from a test taken within 72 hours of travel. Many Muslims outside the kingdom have been barred from making the trip since 2019.
About 2.5m people took part in 2019.

Pilgrims must be under age 65 and fully vaccinated against coronavirus

But after the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, Saudi authorities allowed only 1,000 pilgrims to participate. The following year, they upped the total to 60,000 fully vaccinated Saudi citizens and residents chosen through a lottery.
This year the Saudi Haj ministry “has authorised one million pilgrims, both foreign and domestic, to perform the Haj,” it said in a pre-dawn statement on Saturday.
The government wants to promote pilgrims’ safety “while ensuring that the maximum number of Muslims worldwide can perform the Haj”, the statement said.
Authorities took a number of special measures to reduce the spread of the coronavirus last year, including dividing pilgrims into groups of 20 and handing out disinfectants, masks and sterilised pebbles for the “stoning of Satan” ritual.
But the relatively small crowds were distressing to Muslims abroad.

3,France prepares for first round of presidential elections,The rematch between President Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen will be far tighter than their duel five years ago.,"

PARIS: France on Saturday prepared for the first round of presidential elections projected to produce a run-off rematch between President Emmanuel Macron and far-right leader Marine Le Pen that will be far tighter than their duel five years ago.
All further political activity by candidates was banned on the final day before polls open in mainland France at 0600 GMT on Sunday, after a campaign overshadowed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
French overseas territories will begin voting earlier to take account of the time difference, starting with Saint Pierre and Miquelon off the coast of Canada at 1000 GMT Saturday.
Territories in the Caribbean, the Pacific and finally the Indian Ocean will follow before polling stations open in mainland France.
Polls predict that Macron will lead Le Pen by a handful of percentage points in round one, with the top two going through to a second round on April 24.
But analysts warn that the outcome remains highly volatile with uncertainty remaining over turnout and some observers fearing a quarter of the electorate may stay away in a possible record boycott of the vote.
Far-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon is snapping at their heels in third and still fancies his chances of reaching the second round at the expense of Le Pen or even -- in an extraordinary upset — Macron himself.
Although her opponents accuse her of being an extremist bent on dividing society, Le Pen has with some success during the campaign sought to show a more moderate image and concern with voters’ daily worries such as rising prices.
Macron by contrast has campaigned relatively little, by his own admission entering the election campaign later than he would have wished due to the war in Ukraine.
If Macron and Le Pen as forecast reach the second round, analysts predict that their clash will be far tighter than in 2017 when the current president thrashed his rival with 66 per cent of the vote. “There is an uncertainty ahead of the first round,” said French political scientist Pascal Perrineau, pointing to unprecedented high numbers of voters who were still undecided or who had changed their minds during the campaign as well as absentee voters.
Analysts fear that the 2002 record of the numbers of French voters boycotting a first round of 28.4 per cent risks being beaten, with the 2017 absentee rate of 22.2 per cent almost sure to be exceeded.
“We have experienced a strange campaign that was at odds with what we experienced in the past presidential elections,” Frederic Dabi, director of the Ifop polling institute, said.
The stakes of the election are high for Macron, who came to power aged 39 as France’s youngest president with a pledge to shake up the country.
