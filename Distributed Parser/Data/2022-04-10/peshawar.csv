0,No halt to free treatment under Sehat Card Plus scheme in KP: dept,Officials insist some issues about initiative being sorted out.,"PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa health department has claimed that the people of the province continue to receive free treatment in the hospitals of Punjab, Sindh and Islamabad under the Sehat Card Plus programme.
The claim comes amid reports about the denial of free healthcare under the government scheme by Islamabad and Punjab hospitals.
The KP health officials told Dawn that there was no halt to free treatment under the Sehat Card Plus programme for the residents of the province anywhere in the country.
They, however, said there were some issues regarding the scheme and the relevant authorities were trying to sort them out.

Officials insist some issues about initiative being sorted out

The officials said Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had pioneered the Social Health Protection Initiative (SHPI) under which more than one million people had been given cashless diagnostic and treatment services in hospitals empanelled in all provinces.
They said the Sehat Sahulat Programme was launched by the federal and Punjab governments with the help of the KP health department but they had signed separate agreements with hospitals for it.
The officials said the hospitals empanelled for the scheme in the country totalled 700 and the entertained patients from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab and Islamabad as the State Life Insurance Corporation implemented the initiative on behalf of the respective governments.
They said there were around 250 hospitals in Punjab with which the SHPI had signed agreements for the provision of free services to the population of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The officials said over 50,000 patients from the province had so far received free services in Punjab hospitals, where the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa health department had hired its own staff to facilitate patients.
They said there were some issues between the SSP and Punjab and Islamabad hospitals due to some issues in contracts with the empanelled hospitals.
Officials said the federal and Punjab governments were trying to resolve their issues but the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa population continued to get free services as usual.
They said some hospitals weren’t getting ‘packages’ according to the agreements, so they were denying free treatment to patients, but the residents of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa continued to avail themselves of free healthcare in Lahore, Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Multan and other cities.
“We have 7.4 million families (entire population) of the province registered for free care under the SHPI. They are entitled to receive up to Rs1 million treatment in any registered hospitals of their choice on the production of their identity cards,” a health official told Dawn.
He said the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa residents went to Islamabad and Punjab’s health centres for free liver transplantation under the SHPI as the facility wasn’t available in the province.
The official said all seven liver transplants of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s patients under the SHPI had been done in Islamabad and Punjab’s hospitals.
He said hospitals in Sindh province also offered services to the KP residents registered under the Sehat Card Plus scheme.
The official said the people living in tribal districts were also eligible to receive free treatment under the scheme outside the province.
He said the government recently increased the free treatment ‘package’ from Rs700,000 to Rs1 million per family.

1,Suspension of gas supply to CNG stations protested,PESHAWAR: Owners and employees of CNG stations in Peshawar on Saturday staged a protest against the prolonged...,"PESHAWAR: Owners and employees of CNG stations in Peshawar on Saturday staged a protest against the prolonged suspension of gas supply.
Holding placards and banners, the protesters shouted slogans and demanded smooth gas supply to CNG stations. They asked for solution to the gas supply issues in accordance with the Article 58 of the constitution.
Addressing the protest rally, the All Pakistan CNG Association’s provincial president Fazal Muqeem said the government had announced to ensure gas supply to CNG stations round-the-clock, but it failed to fulfill its commitment.
He said gas supply was suspended for 18 hours without any announcement, troubling the consumers, adding supply was restored for a few hours in the evening.
He appealed to the federal government to reconsider its decision, ensure regular supply to CNG stations, saying permanent closure of filling stations would render employees jobless.
He also demanded of SNGPL to ensure uninterrupted supply to CNG stations, or the owners would move court and launch a protest campaign across the province.
The owners of CNG stations, Mr Muqeem said had no money to pay salaries of workers due to prolonged suspension of gas supply. He resolved to take all possible steps for restoration of gas supply to CNG stations.
“Under Article 158 of Constitution, SNGPL should first fulfill local requirement of the province and then supply surplus gas to other provinces,” Mr Muqeem argued, and said industrial and domestic consumers were also suffering in the prevailing situation.
He said the owners of restaurants/hotels had started using LPG but its price was also increased manifold due to increase in the value of dollar against the Pakistan rupee.
Mr Muqeem said it was astonishing that gas supply was also not available to domestic consumers and the people had started holding protest rallies across the province.

9,"Widow of civil judge seeks Shuhada Package compensation, govt job",Moves PHC after death of husband due to Covid.,"PESHAWAR: The widow of a senior civil judge, who had died of coronavirus last year, has moved the Peshawar High Court seeking orders for the government to give her compensation under the Shuhada Package and a job.
Fatima Kiyani, widow of senior civil judge Seemab Waheed Siddique, has filed a petition with the high court for the grant of the Shuhada Package to her family saying her husband had lost his life in the line of duty while serving in Buner district.
The petition is filed through senior lawyer Mian Muhibullah Kakakhel.
The petitioner contended that like medical workers, judicial officers risked their lives to serve the people amid the raging coronavirus pandemic.
She said that when health professionals had been provided with the Shuhada Package compensation, then why it should be denied to the judicial officers, who had selflessly performed during the pandemic.

Moves PHC after death of husband due to Covid

The petitioner pleaded that the deceased senior civil judge was infected while on duty in Buner, whereas he belonged to Peshawar and thereafter lost his life in July 2021.
She said that the chief justice had earlier announced that the Shuhada Package would be provided to the families of the judges, who would die of Covid-19 in the line of duty.
Ms Fatima, however, said that the finance department didn’t grant her that package.
She complained that she, too, was a lawyer and was denied service in the pay scale of her husband or in accordance with her educational qualifications under the government’s spouse policy.
The petitioner said that her husband’s death had left her and her two minor children to the mercy of the Almighty Allah.
She said that the Shuhada Package compensation was the only ray of hope for her and her children since it included support for education and healthcare along with salary and accommodation, which the government owed to the deceased and his family since her husband had lost life serving the people.
The petitioner requested the court to order the provincial government to give the Shuhada Package to her and her family and employment in the pay scale of her husband or in line with her education.
BAIL REJECTED: An additional district and sessions judge has rejected the bail petition of a a man arrested on the charge of smuggling crystal meth (ice drug) in a rickshaw.
Judge Mohammad Tayyab ruled that the petitioner, Roohul Ameen, a resident of Nowshera, didn’t deserve to be set free on bail.
The suspect was arrested a few days ago while driving a rickshaw in the jurisdiction of the Badabher police station.
The police had claimed they had recovered one kilogramme of crystal meth from secret cavities of the rickshaw. The driver was booked under the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Control of Narcotics Substance Act.
The state prosecutor contended that the rickshaw driver was caught red-handed while smuggling contraband, which was a heinous offence, so he was not entitled to the concession of bail under the law.

POWER OUTAGES: The Pesco consumers here have been irked by increased power outages with the advent of Ramazan, especially during Iftar and Taraveeh timings due to the outdated old Rawalpindi road grid station, which burnt twice last year. 
Meanwhile, for the last two months the Pesco authorities in Kohat had been disconnecting the supply for a whole day twice a week for necessary repairs in the Rawalpindi road grid station. 
The officials have been saying that it is being done to ensure smooth supply during Ramazan. 
However, official sources confided to this correspondent on Saturday that the Rawalpindi road grid station had gone very old and it was overloaded. They said that since its establishment the population had grown five times in the city with the expansions of highways and housing societies. 
Similarly, 15 years ago the lawmakers had promised a new grid station on the same Rawalpindi road for the city and nearby areas. The sources said that billions of rupees were required for the new grid to solve the problem, but the government was delaying issuance of funds.
