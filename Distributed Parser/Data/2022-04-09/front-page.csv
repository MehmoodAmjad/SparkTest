HAFIZ Saeed

 
LAHORE: An anti-terrorism court awarded a combined sentence of 33 years imprisonment to Jamaatud Dawa (JuD) chief Hafiz Muhammad Saeed on Friday in two cases of terror financing registered by the Counter Terrorism Depart­ment (CTD). 
Judge Ejaz Ahmad Buttar handed down the guilty verdict in two FIRs from 2019 under various sections of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) of 1997. 
In one of the cases, the judge awarded five-year impri­sonment each under sections 11-H (2), 11-I, 11-J(2), and 18 months jail under section 11-F(2) of the ATA. 
In the other case, the judge awarded a five-year sentence each under sections 11-N, 11-I, 11-J(2) and an 18-month jail term under section 11-F(6) of the ATA. 
The judge imposed a collective fine of Rs340,000 on Hafiz Saeed in both cases. 
All the sentences will run concurrently. 
Judge Ejaz Buttar observed that the prosecution had established the charges of terror financing against the JuD chief and his role in collecting funds for terrorist activities. 
“The evidence presented by the prosecution against Hafiz Saeed and Al Dawatul Irshad, an outlawed organisation, was tangible and convincing.” 
Several leaders of the JuD, including Hafiz Saeed, are already under detention since July 2019. They had been convicted on the basis of FIRs registered by the CTD on charges of terror fin­a­ncing. Trial proceedings in several others are pending. 
The CTD had registered as many as 41 FIRs against the JuD leaders in different cities. Trial courts have so far decided 27 cases.

1,Disappointed Imran wants protests against ‘imported govt’,ISLAMABAD: Expressing his disappointment on the Supreme Court’s decision that revived the no-confidence motion...,"ISLAMABAD: Expressing his disappointment on the Supreme Court’s decision that revived the no-confidence motion against him, Prime Minister Imran Khan issued a last-ditch call to the nation’s youth to take to the streets on Sunday night against what he termed an “imported government”, which may come into existence over the next few days.
The prime minister, who looked less confident on Friday than his previous addresses to the nation, termed the apex court’s April 7 decision another concessional National Reconciliation Ordinance (NRO) for opposition leaders who are facing corruption references.
In his nearly 30-minute long speech, the PM tried to convey the impression that he was being ousted before his five-year term for his struggle to ensure an independent foreign policy.
“I am disappointed by the Supreme Court’s decision… history never forgets which Supreme Court decision was right or wrong,” the prime minister said.
“Democracy cannot be safeguarded by the army and from outside… It is the nation which always protects the sovereignty of the country,” the prime minister said, calling on the people to protest peacefully against the government which is likely to be formed if the no-confidence resolution against him is passed by the National Assembly today (Saturday).
Unlike his past appearances before the nation, where he appeared more boisterous, the prime minister on Friday night paused for a few seconds before starting his speech.
“I am saddened by the verdict, but I accept it,” he said, adding that it was disappointing how the Supreme Court did not think it appropriate to even see the “threat letter” which was the basis for the deputy speaker’s ruling of April 3. 
“I wanted the SC to at least look at it. It was a very serious allegation that a foreign country wants to topple the government through a conspiracy,” he added.
Mr Khan said he was also saddened at the haste with which the court made its decision and ignored open horse-trading and the buying and selling of lawmakers’ conscience. 
“Every child knows the price at which consciences are being sold… what kind of democracy is this? Which democracy in the world allows [horse-trading]? And the biggest forum for justice, the judiciary, we expected it to take suo motu action, if nothing else,” he added.
However, he was adamant that it was a particular foreign country that did not want to see a leader like him in power in Pakistan which had tried to oust him with the help of corrupt politicians. 
Recounting the context of the threat letter, the PM said that Pakistan’s ambassador in the US was called for a meeting with a US official, who threatened that if the no-confidence motion is unsuccessful, Pakistan would have to face consequences. 
One of his party leaders, Shandana, was called to the US Embassy where she was told that a no-confidence motion will be moved against Imran Khan, he added.
He claimed that he was the only leader in the country who staged demonstrations against US drone attacks in tribal areas of Pakistan and in Afghanistan. “I was the one who opposed US invasion in Iraq and Pakistan’s involvement in war on terror,” he added.
The prime minister also appeared to be hinting at life after being voted out when he said: “I will never sit idle and I will be on streets with a new struggle against this “imported government,” he added.
Opposition reaction
Commenting on the PM’s address, Opposition Leader in the National Assembly Shehbaz Sharif said in a statement that in his speech, Imran Khan had predicted the success of the no-confidence move against him. 
He once again refuted the prime minister’s claim about the ‘threat letter’ from the US and challenged him to make it public. He said the SC had scrapped the ruling of the deputy speaker after examining all evidence and accused Mr Khan of attacking parliament, the Constitution and the judiciary to save his government. 
PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari asked why the government did not produce the threat letter before the Supreme Court during the hearing when the opposition parties had asked for it to be laid before the court.
The PPP chairman said the prime minister had been lying for the past three years and had told another lie in his latest speech. He claimed they had defeated the PTI in parliament and in court, and soon they would defeat them at the polls.

2,IHC declares Peca ordinance unconstitutional,"Scraps Section 20 of act that criminalised defamation; opposition parties, PFUJ welcome decision...","ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court on Friday declared the controversial Prevention of Elect­ronic Crimes (Amendment) Ordinance unconstitutional and also scrapped Section 20 of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) 2016 that had criminalised defamation. 
The PTI government had promulgated the ordinance in February at a time when the legality of Peca’s Section 20 was already under examination before the IHC. Two factions of the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ), Pakistan Broadcasters Association (PBA) and others had challenged the ordinance. 
IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah issued a short order stating “the petitions are allowed”. 
The court order noted: “Freedom of expression is a fundamental right and it reinforces all other rights guaranteed under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973… [and] free speech protected under Article 19 and the right to receive information under Article 19-A of the Constitution are essential for development, progress and prosperity of a society and suppression thereof is unconstitutional and contrary to the democratic values.” 

Scraps Section 20 of act that criminalised defamation; opposition parties, PFUJ welcome decision

The court observed that “the criminalisation of defamation, protection of individual reputations through arrest and imprisonment and the resultant chilling effect violates the letter of the Constitution and the invalidity thereof is beyond reasonable doubt. The Prevention of Electronic Crimes (Amendment) Ordinance, 2022 was promulgated in derogation of the Constitution and the fundamental rights guaranteed thereunder, particularly Articles 9, 14, 19 and 19-A. The jurisdictional preconditions were also not in existence”. 
Subsequently, the court declared: “The Prevention of Electronic Crimes (Amendment) Ordinance, 2022 and promulgation thereof is declared as unconstitutional, invalid beyond reasonable doubt and it is, therefore, struck down.” 
Moreover, Justice Minallah declared that “the offence under Section 20 of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 to the extent of the expression or harms the reputation and the punishment thereof is unconstitutional, invalid beyond reasonable doubt and is, therefore, struck down”. 
The controversial ordinance through an amendment to Section 2 stated that the “person includes any company, association or body of persons whether incorporated or not, institutions, organisations, authority or any other body established by the government.” It enabled any person to lodge a complaint over criticism of even the working of a civic body. 
The high court scrapped the proceedings in Peca cases. “However, the aggrieved complainants would be at liberty to avail the remedies provided under the respective laws in the context of defamation,” the order said. 
It asked the federal government to review defamation laws, particularly the Defamation Ordinance 2002 and thereafter propose appropriate legislation. 
Justice Minallah directed the interior secretary to probe the conduct of officials of the Cybercrime Wing of Federal Investigation Agency, which had led to widespread abuse of powers and the consequent grave violations of fundamental rights of the citizens. 
“The court expects that the Secretary, Ministry of Interior, will conclude the probe within 30 from the date of receiving a certified copy of this order and inform the registrar regarding action taken against the delinquent officials,” the order said. 
Decision hailed
Opposition parties PML-N and PPP welcomed the IHC decision. 
In a tweet, PMLN spokesperson Marriyum Aurangzeb congratulated the people of Pakistan, journalists, civil society and media institutions, including PBA, All Pakistan Newspapers Society, Council of Pakistan Newspaper Editors, PFUJ and Association of Electronic Media Editors and News Directors. 
“The judiciary has ruled that no one can make the media and the people blind, deaf and dumb,” she said, adding that protecting civil liberties and freedom of expression enshrined in the Constitution was in fact ensuring the protection of the Constitution and democracy. 
PPP’s central information secretary Shazia Atta Marri said her party warmly welcomed the IHC decision, terming it a victory of the Constitution. 
“We congratulate the entire nation and the journalists’ community of the country on this constitutional victory,” MNA Marri said in a statement, adding that “selected Imran Khan Niazi wanted to snatch the freedom of expression of the common man like dictators of the past”. 
She said the PPP had already rejected the draconian black law of Peca, and today (Friday) the IHC had taken a constitutional step by declaring the Peca amendment ordinance unconstitutional. She said Imran Khan’s government had turned the President House into a “centre of conspiracies”. 
PFUJ president Shahzada Zulfiqar and secretary general Nasir Zaidi said the IHC decision was a victory of all democratic forces and champions of human rights. 
“The journalist fraternity especially deserves appreciation as it was the first to spring into action, taking notice of the ordinance, involving all the stakeholders and civil society and approaching the court against the black ordinance,” they said in a statement.

3,Strike on train station kills 50 in Ukraine,"EU officials in Kyiv for talks and visit to scene of civilian deaths in Bucha; Japan, Finland to expel Russian diplomats.","• EU officials in Kyiv for talks and visit to scene of civilian deaths in Bucha
• Japan, Finland to expel Russian diplomats; Turkey pushes for talks
KRAMATORSK: In one of the deadliest strikes of the six-week-old Ukrainian war, at least 50 people were killed and hundreds injured on Friday when a rocket hit a train station in the eastern city of Kramatorsk, drawing strong reactions from European Union and several other countries including Japan that decided to expel eight Russian diplomats and trade representatives. 
However, the Russian defence ministry was quoted by RIA news agency as saying the missiles said to have struck the station were used only by Ukraine’s military and that Russia’s armed forces had no targets assigned in Kramatorsk on Friday.
The bombing came at a time when European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell were in Kyiv for talks with President Volodymyr Zelensky and to visit the scene of civilian deaths in Bucha. Zelensky said no Ukrainian troops were at the station, calling it ‘a deliberate attack on civilians’ with 50 deaths and 300 reportedly injured. “Russian forces (fired) on an ordinary train station, on ordinary people,” he told Finland’s parliament in a video address.
Regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said the station was hit by a Tochka U short-range ballistic missile containing cluster munitions. However, Russia’s defence ministry said suggestions it had carried out the attack were “absolutely untrue”.
Reuters was unable to verify what happened in Kramatorsk.
Officials have begged civilians to flee, while the intensity of fighting is impeding evacuations. However, officials continued to press civilians to leave. “There is no secret — the battle for Donbas will be decisive. What we have already experienced — all this horror — it can multiply,” warned Lugansk regional governor Sergiy Gaiday. “Leave! The next few days are the last chances. Buses will be waiting for you in the morning,” he added.
Moscow has denied targeting civilians but growing evidence of atrocities has galvanised Ukraine’s allies to pile on more pressure.
The EU earlier approved an embargo on Russian coal and the closure of its ports to Russian vessels as part of a “very substantial” new round of sanctions that also includes an export ban and new measures against Russian banks. In addition, it backed a proposal to boost its funding of arms supplies to Ukraine by 500 million euros ($544 million), taking it to a total of 1.5 billion euros. So far, the bloc had frozen 30 billion euros in assets from blacklisted Russian and Belarusian individuals and companies under sanctions, it said Friday.
En route to Kyiv, Borrell told journalists the EU would supply 7.5 million euros to train Ukrainian prosecutors to investigate war crimes.
At the United Nations, 93 of the General Assembly’s 193 members voted on Thursday to suspend Russia from the body’s human rights council over its actions in Ukraine. 
In his video address to the Finnish parliament, President Zelensky called for a “cocktail” of sanctions, scolding “those who are making us wait, wait for the things that we need badly, wait for the means of protecting our lives”.
His appeal echoed a call from his foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, who earlier asked Nato for heavy weaponry, including air defence systems, artillery, armoured vehicles and jets. “Either you help us now – and I’m speaking about days, not weeks – or your help will come too late and many people will die, many civilians will lose their homes, many villages will be destroyed,” FM Kuleba said after meeting Nato foreign ministers in Brussels.
Finland, Japan expel diplomats
Finland said it would expel two Russian diplomats over the war in Ukraine, following a wave of similar moves across Europe. “The measure is in line with those taken by other EU member states,” the PM Office stated.
“In addition the visa extension of one Russian embassy staff member has been cancelled.” This week EU countries expelled almost 200 Russian diplomats over two days for alleged spying or “national security reasons” amid increasing outrage over apparent evidence of widespread killing of Ukrainian civilians by Russian troops.
Also in a rare move for Japan, its foreign ministry announced it was expelling eight diplomats and trade representatives as part of a comprehensive judgment that included condemnation of Russia’s killing of civilians.
Tokyo also announced it would ban coal imports from Russia. Trade minister Koichi Hagiuda said it would reduce imports gradually while looking for alternative suppliers in the wake of sanctions against Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. However, he said, “We would need to find alternative suppliers or we would face difficulties securing domestic coal which could lead to power outages and such. We need to avoid such a situation.
“We will cooperate with Russian sanctions without inflicting a burden on domestic industry”.
US, EU condemn attack
The White House decried the “horrific and devastating images” of the attack which EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, in Kyiv with the head of the EU executive Ursula von der Leyen, condemned on Twitter as “yet another attempt to close escape routes for those fleeing this unjustified war.” 
Ukrainian officials say Russia’s military is regrouping after withdrawing eastwards from the zone around Kyiv, where a forensics team on Friday began exhuming a mass grave in the town of Bucha. The grave’s discovery last week galvanised the West into toughening sanctions against Russia and speeding up arms deliveries to Ukraine.
Turkey pushes for talks
However, Turkey is pushing to revive talks between Russia and Ukraine stalled after atrocities were uncovered in Bucha and other regions near Kyiv, saying both countries are still ready to meet on its soil. Ankara assures that the two warring sides are still “willing to hold talks” in Turkey in a bid to move towards a solution to the six-week war. 
“Both Russia and Ukraine are willing to hold the talks in Turkey but they are far away from agreeing on a common text,” a high-ranking Turkish official told journalists on Friday. There are “some issues pending”, including the status of the Donbas and Crimea regions as well as security guarantees, according to the official, who said no date had been fixed for the next round of talks.
Russia has called allegations that its forces executed civilians in Bucha a “monstrous forgery” aimed at denigrating its army.
The Kremlin said on Friday the “special operation” could end in the “foreseeable future” with its aims being achieved with work by the Russian military and peace negotiators.
Russian forces have however failed to take any major cities so far, confronted by unexpectedly strong Ukrainian resistance and dogged by what Western intelligence officials say have been logistical, supply and morale problems.
Britain would send Ukraine a further 100 million pounds ($130 million) of military support, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday, and defence sources in Prague said the Czech Republic had delivered tanks, rocket launchers, howitzers and infantry fighting vehicles and would ship more.
Ukraine’s military general staff said on Friday that Russian troops were focused on capturing the besieged southeastern port of Mariupol, fighting near the eastern city of Izyum and breakthroughs by Ukrainian forces near Donetsk.
The West has imposed more sanctions on Russia since the images surfaced, with Washington sanctioning top Russian lenders and President Vladimir Putin’s daughters, a move echoed by Britain on Friday, while the EU banned nearly 20 billion euros worth of trade, including Russian coal.
Zelensky has urged Brussels to also ban Russian oil and gas. Borrell said a potential oil ban would be discussed on Monday in Brussels, but called oil sanctions “a big elephant in the room” given concerns over its impact on Europe’s economy and its consumers.

4,"ECP not to wait for digital census, decides to begin delimitation",Sets timeframe of four months for completion of the exercise on the basis of the 2017 census results.,"ISLAMABAD: The Elec­tion Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Friday ordered delimitation of National and provincial assembly constituencies on war-footing, without waiting for the digital census to commence.
The commission had earlier blamed the government for not cooperating and delaying the finalisation and publication of fresh digital census results, which subsequently led to a delay in delimitation.
The commission, which met here with Chief Elec­tion Commissioner Sikan­dar Sultan Raja presiding over, set a timeframe of four months for completion of the exercise on the basis of the 2017 census and population statistics. The meeting was attended by two ECP members besides senior officials, including the secretary and special secretary.
The meeting decided that the ECP would write to the provincial governments, seeking maps and relevant data immediately so the delimitation process could be completed on time. It also directed the secretary and special secretary to present to it a complete plan of action for the general elections on April 13.
The commission stressed it was fully committed to fulfilling its constitutional duty towards continuity of the democratic processes, fair play and rule of law.
The meeting was also apprised of the non-provision of funds by the Finance Division for conducting local government elections in Punjab for which the commission had written to the division.
Upon the Finance Division’s advice, the ECP had sent a summary for a supplementary grant to the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) for its approval, which the ECC further sent to the cabinet after approving. The Finance Division then communicated the cabinet’s approval for the required funds to the ECP through official correspondence.
When the ECP had recently asked the division to release the funds, it was told that it would require a No-Objection Certificate from the Punjab government. The commission took serious notice of the issue and maintained it was a financially and administratively independent body under the Constitution. The federal and all provincial governments were bound to provide administrative and financial support to it. But, for various reasons, hurdles were being created in the ECP’s process of fulfilling its constitutional responsibilities.
To ensure timely conduct of the local government elections in Punjab, the ECP decided to summon the federal finance secretary and Punjab chief secretary. It shall issue appropriate orders after hearing both the officials.
The meeting noted that any further delay in the overdue LG elections in Punjab would be a clear violation of the law and Constitution. It also decided to reschedule the by-elections in NA-33 Hangu to April 17, which were earlier scheduled for April10, but had to be put off following the dissolution of the National Assembly and pendency of the matter before the Supreme Court.
The seat had fallen vacant following the death of PTI lawmaker Khial Zaman Orakzai after battling cancer for several months.
The commission ordered the electoral rolls be updated and reviewed as early as possible.

5,KP opposition submits no-trust motion against CM Mahmood Khan,"PTI is the single largest party in the 145-member house with 94 members, while 51 legislators sit on the opposition benches.","PESHAWAR: In the already charged political atmosphere in the country, opposition parties in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly on Friday submitted a notice for a no-confidence motion against Chief Minister Mahmood Khan, apparently in an attempt to preempt the dissolution of the provincial assembly. 
The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) is the single largest party in the 145-member house with 94 members, while 51 legislators sit on the opposition benches. 
The no-confidence notice was submitted by a group of opposition lawmakers to the assembly’s secretary Kifa­yatullah Afridi at his office. 
The provincial assembly is already in session and the speaker has adjourned the sitting to May 10. The ongoing session has been summoned by the government. 
The motion submitted to the assembly secretariat states: “We beg to move that leave may be granted under sub-rule (1) of rule 18D of the Provincial Assembly of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Procedure and Conduct of Business Rules to move a resolution of no-confidence against the Chief Minister under Article 136 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan”.
The proposed resolution submitted by the opposition members read: “Whereas Mr Mahmood Khan has ceased to command the confidence of the majority of the members of this assembly as the chief minister, it is hereby resolved that Mr Mahmoood Khan shall stand ceased to hold the said office.” 
Those who submitted the notice include Sardar Hussain Babak, Khushdil Khan and Shagufta Malik of the Awami National Party (ANP), Pakistan Peoples Party MPA Nighat Orakzai, Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal (MMA) MPA Mian Nisar Gul and Baluchistan Awami Party’s Bilawal Afridi. 
The notice carried the signatures of 36 lawmakers of the joint opposition, including 17 of the MMA, 12 of the ANP, six of the PPP and one of Jamaat-i-Islami. 
Before submitting the notice, the opposition parties held a meeting at the chamber of the opposition leader during which strategy for the no-confidence motion was discussed. Opposition leader Akran Khan Durani couldn’t attend the meeting because of his engagements in Islamabad. 
After the meeting, ANP’s parliamentary leader Sardar Hussain Babak also handed over a letter to the assembly’s secretary, reminding the latter that supremacy of the Constitution and implementation of the law of land were the responsibility of every citizen. 
“We believe that the proceedings of the KP Assembly will be run under the Constitution, law and rules of business,” the letter stated, adding that some unconstitutional and unlawful steps in the National Assembly as well as in Punjab Assembly had created political crisis. 
PTI’s chief whip in the KP Assembly Shaukat Yousafzai, in a video message released to the media, termed the opposition’s move of no-confidence a joke. 
“How 51 members of the opposition will defeat the ruling party having support of 94 members,” he wondered. The PTI would not allow horse-trading as it was a strong force in the province, he declared. 
He dispelled the impression that submission of the notice was handiwork of the treasury and opposition to save the assembly from dissolution. “Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is the strong castle of Prime Minister Imran Khan,” said Mr Yousafzai, who is also minister for labour department.

6,"NA gets another shot at history, no-confidence",No-trust resolution filed against Qasim Suri; PM Imran strategises with PTI parliamentary group.,"• No-trust resolution filed against Qasim Suri
• Imran strategises with PTI parliamentary group
• Opposition to bring dissidents into play only if needed
ISLAMABAD: All eyes are fixed on the National Assembly today, which is set to vote on the crucial no-confidence resolution against Prime Minister Imran Khan in line with Thursday’s Supreme Court verdict.
But despite an impression that it has lost its majority in the lower house, the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) is still adamant that it would not leave the field open for the opposition and has vowed to make things as difficult for them as they can, be it creating hurdles in the voting procedure or preventing the election of opposition nominee Shehbaz Sharif as the new leader of the house.
According to Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry, the government will present the ‘threatening’ cable or its contents in the assembly and will ask the speaker for a debate on the issue. 
Speaking to ARY News on Friday night, he was of the opinion that even though the vote of no confidence was on the agenda, voting would likely not take place on Saturday.
He said that while the SC had instructed voting to be held in the session called on April 9, that doesn’t mean it will have to be on the same date.
No-trust against Suri
In another significant move, the opposition on Friday submitted a no-confidence resolution against Deputy Speaker Qasim Suri, which contains three charges, chief among which is the issuance of the controversial April 3 ruling, which was subsequently declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.
The no-confidence resolution against Mr Suri, along with a motion seeking permission for it to be put to vote, was submitted to the National Assembly Secretariat by Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) MNA and former deputy speaker Murtaza Javed Abbasi.
In the resolution, the opposition has accused Mr Suri of “repeatedly violating the rules, parliamentary practices, democratic norms and traditions and even constitutional provisions”. 
They alleged that “instead of performing his role fairly and impartially, the deputy speaker has acted in a blatantly partisan manner invariably favouring the government, especially in passing legislation, and has frequently deprived the opposition members of their inherent, democratic right to speak and voice their views and the views of their electorate”.
Moreover, while referring to the SC’s verdict, it alleges that “the deputy speaker has wilfully and malafide-ly (sic) subverted the Constitution and his action falls within the purview of Article 6 of the Constitution”.
The opposition had already submitted a no-confidence resolution against Speaker Asad Qaiser minutes before the start of the National Assembly sitting on April 3, when the house had been called to vote on the no-trust resolution against the PM.
The orders of the day for today’s sitting remain the same as those issued for the April 3 session. The sitting is expected to commence around 10.30am.

 





 
Ahead of the session, on Friday, Prime Minister Imran Khan presided over a meeting of the party’s parliamentary group which, according to some media reports, was attended by 98 members. On the other hand, the opposition is also planning to convene meeting of its parliamentary group this morning (Saturday).
Opposition strategy
Opposition sources told Dawn that after acquiring the required numbers in the assembly to make their no-confidence resolution successful, through the support of former PTI allies and independents, opposition parties had decided not to bring into play the 22 PTI dissidents they claim to have on their side, as it would open them up to possible disqualification under Article 63-A of the Constitution.
Leaders belonging to the PML-N and the PPP claimed that they had devised their strategy for the Saturday’s sitting and they had directed their members to remain “cool and patient” in case the treasury members took some steps to provoke them in order to create disturbance.
“Yes. We will not ask the PTI members (dissidents) to vote as we have the sufficient numbers required to oust the government. These PTI members will be in reserve and some of them can be asked to vote only in case of an emergency if any of the members is found missing,” a senior PPP leader told Dawn.
When asked why these dissidents had polled their votes on April 3 during the opposition-convened session, the PPP leader said they had cast their votes on their own because they knew that it was a symbolic sitting.
Commenting on reports that the PTI had decided to prolong the voting process through lengthy speeches during the NA sitting, PML-N’s secretary general Ahsan Iqbal said any attempt to prevent members from casting their vote on the no-confidence resolution against the prime minister would amount to “contempt of court” as the SC in its verdict had clearly stated that voting on the resolution must take place on Saturday.
Earlier in the day, speaking at a news conference, Mr Iqbal hoped that the speaker and the staff of the National Assembly Secretariat would ensure the implementation of the SC verdict, which was quite clear that the assembly session would resume on Saturday from the point where it had been prorogued by the deputy speaker without putting the resolution for a vote through his controversial ruling.
Mr Iqbal said the opposition had a “clean and non-controversial majority” of 177 members who belonged to the opposition parties as well as the parties which were formerly allies of the PTI.
“It has now become the PTI vs the rest,” said Mr Iqbal.
The PML-N secretary general and MNA from Narowal also warned NA staff from attempting to violate the apex court verdict.
