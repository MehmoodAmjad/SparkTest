Unlike previous JWG meetings, the sixth meeting witnessed active participation and presentations by the provincial National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) in China to strengthen business-to-business (B2B) collaborations at the provincial levels between both countries.
NDRC DG Ying Xiong and Secretary of the Board of Investment Fareena Mazhar co-chaired the meeting where provincial NDRCs vowed to collaborate with Pakistan’s provincial BOIs for joint efforts to bring in meaningful foreign direct investment and strike B2B ventures. The Chinese side showed keen interest in the mining sector of Pakistan. China Geological Survey and Metallurgical Corporation of China presented their proposals for collaboration in the mining sector of Pakistan.

Sixth meeting of joint working group reviews progress on special economic zones

The Pakistan Mineral Development Corporation gave a detailed presentation highlighting the potential of the sector and possible investment opportunities for Chinese investors.
The BoI also presented a proposal for establishing a CPEC tower in Islamabad and a Special Economic Zone in the federal capital for government-to-government linkages. Ms Mazhar informed the meeting that development of the four special economic zones were steadily advancing and substantial progress has been achieved in this regard. 
The BOI secretary pointed out Covid-19 pandemic had restricted both Pakistan and China to initiate the marketing work for the economic zones. It was proposed that the two countries could develop a mechanism for promoting the special zones through events in China as well as in other countries to encourage third country participation.
The Chinese side may encourage its enterprises to set up businesses in Pakistan. 
Ms Mazhar said the BOI strongly felt that greater impetus must be generated in enhancing B2B and people-to-people linkages; to facilitate increased level of investment from Chinese enterprises , and to enhance industrial competitiveness of businesses in Pakistan; through technology transfer, world class managerial and industrial practices and skills transfer.
For B2B matchmaking, it was proposed, a unified online portal could also be developed mutually for data gathering of potential companies to form joint ventures. The BoI secretary also suggested effective utilization of the platform of Pakistan-China Business and Investment Forum (PCBIF), which was established jointly by the BOI, Chinese embassy and the All-Pakistan Chinese Enterprises’ Association, to facilitate and encourage matchmaking of businesses from both sides.

1,Industrialists reject hike in interest rates for export financing,KARACHI: While the industrialists continued to vent their anger over the central bank’s decision to raise the...,"KARACHI: While the industrialists continued to vent their anger over the central bank’s decision to raise the interest rate by 250 basis points to 12.25 per cent, they also rejected the move to hike interest rates for financing under the Export Finance Scheme (EFS) by 2.5pc. 
Employers Federation of Pakistan (EFP) president Ismail Suttur said if such actions subsist, the business community is bound to see another setback in terms of exports. The so-called solution to the problem is actually adding fuel to the fire by spiking up prices of cost of goods sold for the business community and hence contributing to an increase in prices for the average everyday individual, eventually pushing the local businessmen out of foreign markets. 
He said the abrupt and unstable decision to increase the interest rate has led Pakistan to become one of the most inflated countries in the region, since the start of 2022. Interest rates in corresponding countries such as India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Bhutan are still in a range of four to 7.16 per cent. On the other hand, Pakistan is experiencing socio-economic instability to a large extent driven to sudden rash decisions in the name of stability, he added. 
President of the Korangi Association of Trade and Ind­ustry (Kati) Salman Aslam said the hike in interest rate by 2.5pc would cause irreparable damage to the economy. 
With already rising cost of production, it would be very difficult to compete with regional countries after increase in the interest rate which may also affect export orders, he said. 
Chairman of the Businessmen Group Zubair Motiwala criticised the increase in the interest rate and urged the SBP governor to immediately revisit this decision as it would prove disastrous for the economy, exports and industries.

2,Punjab govt mulling action against dissidents ahead of CM’s election,"Disqualification, court’s restraining order under defection clauses being considered.","LAHORE: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) and PML-Q ruling coalition in Punjab is working on springing a surprise for the joint opposition to block Hamza Shehbaz’s election as the chief minister of the province.
The allies claim to get at least 24 ruling party dissidents disqualified under the Constitution’s defection clause under Article 63A or restrain them from voting against the party line under Article 63A(1) – to strip off the joint opposition’s majority in the Punjab Assembly for the April 16 election for the chief minister.
However, the PML-N believes the clause wouldn’t apply to the dissidents since they won’t be voting against a candidate from their own party, but from an allied party.
If the opposition is unable to show the required strength of 186 MPAs during the election, PTI leaders say, the Punjab Assembly would have to go for a “run-off election”, wherein a winner would only need a simple majority in the House.

Disqualification, court’s restraining order under defection clauses being considered

Mr Shehbaz had shown the support of 199 MPAs for him as the chief minister at a mock assembly session at a local hotel, which included at least 24 PTI dissidents commonly known as the Jahangir Tareen, Aleem Khan and former provincial minister Malik Asad Khokhar groups.
On the other hand, the PTI, on Friday, issued show-cause notices to its 24 dissident MPAs and asked them to appear at the party office and explain why they were being seen as showing support to the opposition parties. The notices have been issued on the basis of videos displayed on TV channels, newspaper reports and other ‘evidence’.
In case the dissident MPAs fail to appear or explain their position, party chairman Imran Khan will send a reference against each MPA to the Punjab Assembly speaker and the Election Commission of Pakistan.
Meanwhile, the coalition’s candidate for the CM’s slot Parvez Elahi’s spokesman Fayyazul Hassan Chohan confirmed at a media talk that the Punjab Assembly speaker’s office had completed the spadework to take action against the dissidents and a reference would be sent to the ECP.
Since the ECP can take up to 30 days to decide on the reference, the PTI government plans to file a petition in the Lahore High Court to restrain its MPAs from polling for the opposition – to pave the way for a run-off election.
“I will myself approach the Lahore High Court on Monday seeking a restraint order against PTI dissident MPAs from polling their votes in violation of the party instructions under Article 63A(1) of the Constitution,” Mr Chohan said while speaking to the media on the Punjab Assembly premises.
He said he would ask the court to deliver a prompt decision against the dissidents as they were ridiculing the mandate of millions of people of Pakistan. The dissident MPAs’ votes would only hold any value when polled for their own party.
Mr Chohan also welcomed the Supreme Court’s decision against the National Assembly deputy speaker’s ruling dismissing the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Imran Khan and subsequent dissolution of the assembly.
PM Khan had recently asked all PTI MPAs in Punjab, in a tweet, to ensure their vote for Mr Elahi in the CM’s election. “Any PTI MPA going against party direction, including abstaining from vote, will be disqualified and face strict disciplinary action,” Mr Khan had warned.
In order to drive Punjab Assembly proceedings as per the government’s whims, Elahi, being the speaker, had withdrawn the powers delegated to the deputy speaker through a notification. The assembly proceedings will likely be administered through a nominee on the Panel of Chairmen of the Punjab Assembly.
The PML-Q and PTI members have already submitted a no-confidence motion against Deputy Speaker Dost Muhammad Mazari, demanding his removal.
Meanwhile, some TV channels reported that some important files and documents had been removed from the Punjab Assembly as a safeguard, in case the PML-N formed a government. The channels, quoting assembly secretariat officials, also reported that the documents were related to recruitments, contracts for the construction, repair and maintenance of assembly building.
However, the speaker’s spokesman Chohan vehemently denied the reports.
PML-N on defection proceedings
Meanwhile, the opposition PML-N claims that since the dissident PTI MPAs were going to vote against an allied par­ty’s (PML-Q) candidate and not one from their own party, def­­ection clause of the Constitution would not apply to them. 
“Mr (Parvez) Elahi is not the parliamentary leader of the PTI therefore all those PTI lawmakers who will vote against him in the CM’s election can’t be de-seated,” asserted the outspoken PML-N Punjab information secretary Azma Bokhari.

3,Govt forms probe commission on ‘foreign conspiracy’,Retired lieutenant general asked to head commission excuses himself due to concerns about viability of ‘threat letter’...,"ISLAMABAD: In what could be its last cabinet meeting, the PTI government on Friday formed a commission to investigate a “threat letter”, which purportedly contains evidence of a foreign conspiracy hatched to oust Prime Minister Imran Khan. 
Mr Khan presided over the federal cabinet and PTI parliamentary party meetings on Friday, in which it was decided that some contents of the demarche sent by the former Pakistani ambassador to the United States regarding the “international conspiracy” would be shared with MNAs.
Meanwhile, Tariq Khan, a retired lieutenant general who was nominated by the government to head the commission, has regretted taking this responsibility “because of his concerns about [the letter’s] viability”.
“I have regretted. The commission cannot last beyond this government. The vote of no confidence will bring in the new government. They will dissolve the commission or not cooperate with it, making it dysfunctional,” he said. He also rejected rumours that he declined the job because of pressure. “No one can force me to do anything,” he asserted.

Retired lieutenant general asked to head commission excuses himself due to concerns about viability of ‘threat letter’

However, a cabinet member said Mr Tariq’s appointment was publicly announced only after he had consented to the appointment.  
During the cabinet and PTI parliamentary meetings on Friday, it was suggested that all members of the treasury benches should submit their resignations to National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser. 
Another suggestion was that the PTI should appeal against the Supreme Court’s decision that nullified the April 3 ruling of National Assembly Deputy Speaker Qasim Suri, in which he dismissed a no-trust motion against the prime minister.
It has been learnt that the cabinet also expressed displeasure over the Election Commission of Pakistan’s statement that it could not hold general elections before seven months.
Meanwhile, Mr Qaiser has summoned a session of the lower house of parliament on Saturday (today), with the no-confidence vote on the agenda.
Fawad laments SC ruling
After the federal cabinet meeting, Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry told reporters the government had decided to present the contents of the “threat letter” in the National Assembly today.
The minister told Dawn the original records of the cipher, only available with the government, could not be shared with the parliamentarians, and that only some of its contents would be brought out into the open.
He believed that sharing the contents of the letter “may shake the conscience” of the MNAs before voting on the no-confidence resolution.
“If, even after that, [the opposition] wants to go with the no-confidence vote, then the people of Pakistan will decide who’s standing where,” he said. 
Informing that the commission would be headed by retired Lt Gen Tariq Khan, the minister also shared the terms of reference (ToRs) of the commission with the media.
As Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Shehbaz Sharif had questioned the existence of the “threat letter”, the minister said it was included in the commission’s ToRs that it would determine whether the letter was genuine and contained any threats.
“The commission should also investigate recent meetings of foreign officials with the PTI dissidents MNAs ahead of the no-trust motion,” he said. The commission had been given 90 days to conclude its investigation over the “regime change plot”, he said. 
The minister said although the letter was a secret document, it could be presented in parliament. However, a constitutional expert believed that such a secret document could only be shared during an in-camera session.
Lamenting the Supreme Court’s judgem­ent on the deputy speaker’s ruling, Fawad Chaudhry said: “The supremacy of parliament has shifted to the Supreme Court.” 
Meanwhile, Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed told media persons after the cabinet meeting that he had suggested to the prime minister that all MNAs on treasury benches should give their resignations to the speaker. “I advised the prime minister to enforce an emergency and give resignations, and today I have again given the same suggestion,” he said.
‘Nation must protect sovereignty’
Later, Prime Minister Khan, during an interview on a private TV channel on Friday, said the nation would have to safeguard its sovereignty at a time when the country was faced with a regime change conspiracy.
“At a time when the conspiracy of regime change is being hatched, the nation will have to protect its sovereignty. Who else will do it?” he said.
The prime minister said a nation of 220 million people was unfortunate to have the leaders with a mindset of “beggars can’t be choosers”.
“The nations always emerge through self-esteem… Pakistan has great potential. This nation will rise anytime. We are yet on the course to become a nation,” he remarked.
To a question, the prime minister said the state of Madina could not be replicated in Pakistan all of a sudden. Though very few people led every struggle initially, the whole nation would have to ultimately play its role, he said. Unfortunately, the country’s education system never taught youngsters Seeratun Nabi (life of Prophet Muhammad PBUH) and it needed to be rectified, the premier said.

4,"Attorney general to stay, for now",He told the SC earlier this week “this will be my last case” as govt’s law officer and “I won’t like to be indicted by history”.,"ISLAMABAD: Attorney General Khalid Jawed Khan, who intends to resign soon after hearing concludes on the presidential reference regarding interpretation of the defection clause under Article 63-A of the Constitution, may stay in the coveted post for a day or two more. 
An informed source told Dawn that the AGP met Prime Minister Imran Khan on Friday and the latter asked him to hold his horses and stay for a while in his office. 
“Life always aborts our plans and opts for its own timing,” the AGP had obser­ved in his speech at the April 4 farewell full court reference on the retirement of Justice Maqbool Baqar. 
The speech was made a day after National Assem­bly’s Deputy Speaker Qasim Suri prorogued the session without vote on the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Imran Khan. 
The development gave rise to rumours that the AGP’s resignation is round the corner. 
But the AGP himself laid the matter to rest by saying in his address at the full court reference that he had decided to resign immediately after the conclusion of hearing on the presidential reference. 
The attorney general exp­lained that given the recent events on the political chessboard, immediate resignat­ion on his part would be like­­­­n­ed to the proverbial jumping of rats from a sinking ship. “I won’t be able to live with this legacy,” he said. 
“Whether one agrees or disagrees with the course and journey of a vessel, one must not jump the ship and leave it in stormy waters, particularly when one has enjoyed the cruise,” the AGP had observed in his speech. 
Khalid Jawed peppered the concluding part of his speech with a metaphorical reference to Titanic: “So I remain on the Titanic and bid your lordship (Justice Baqar) farewell from its deck.” 
The AGP had told a group of reporters earlier this year that he had decided to resign soon after the retirement of Chief Justice Gulzar Ahmed in February. 
He had told a five-judge Supreme Court bench hearing the dissolution case this week that “this will be my last case” as the government’s law officer and that “I won’t like to be indicted by history”. 
He had suggested before the court hearing the deputy speaker’s ruling and dissolution case that the court, instead of “indulging in judicial activism”, should exercise judicial statesmanship and honour the decision of the government. 
During the April 7 suo motu hearing on the deputy speaker’s ruling, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhel observed that the court wanted the assistance of the AGP not only in this case but also in the pending presidential reference.

5,Sound of Mughal-era sarangi fading away,"LAHORE: In the shadow of Lahore’s centuries-old Badshahi Mosque, Zohaib Hassan plucks at the strings of a sarangi,...","LAHORE: In the shadow of Lahore’s centuries-old Badshahi Mosque, Zohaib Hassan plucks at the strings of a sarangi, filling the streets with a melodious hum and cry.
Remarkable for its resemblance to the human voice, the classical instrument is fading from Pakistan’s music scene — except for a few players dedicated to preserving its place.
Difficult to master, expensive to repair, and with little financial reward for professionals, the sar­angi’s decline has been difficult to halt, says Hassan. “We are trying to keep the instrument alive, not even taking into account our miserable financial condition.”
For seven generations, his family has mastered the bowed, short-necked instrument and Hassan is well-respected across the country for his abilities, regularly appearing on television, radio and at private parties.
“My family’s craze for the ins­t­r­­­ument forced me to pursue a career as a sarangi player, leaving my education incomplete,” he said.
“I live hand-to-mouth as the majority of directors arrange musical programmes with the latest orchestras and pop bands.” 
Traditional instruments are competing with a booming R&B and pop scene in a country where more than 60 per cent of the population is aged under 30.
Sara Zaman, a classical music teacher at the National Council of Arts in Lahore, said alongside the sarangi, other traditional instruments such as the sitar, santoor, and tanpura are also dying out.
“Platforms have been given to other disciplines like pop music, but it has been missing in the case of classical music,” she said.
“The sarangi, being a very difficult instrument, has not been given due importance and attention in Pakistan leading to its gradual demise.” 
‘The strings of my heart’ 
The sarangi gained prominence in Indian classical music in the 17th century, during the reign of the Mughals in the subcontinent.
Its decline began in the 1980s after the death of several master players and classical singers in the country, said Khwaja Najam-ul-Hassan, a TV director who has created an archive of Pakistan’s leading musicians.
Ustad Allah Rakha, one of the country’s most globally acclaimed sarangi players, died in 2015 after a career that saw him perform with orchestras around the world.
Now players say they struggle to survive on performance fees alone, often much smaller than those paid to modern guitarists, pianists or violinists.
Carved by hand from a single block of cedar native to parts of Pakistan, the sarangi’s primary strings are made of goat gut while the 17 sympathetic strings — a common feature on subcontinent folk instruments — are steel.
The instrument costs around Rs120,000 and most of its parts are imported from India, where it remains a principal part of the canon.
“The price has gone up as there is a ban on imports from India,” said Muhammad Tahir, who owns one of two repair shops in city.
Pakistan downgraded diplomatic ties and stopped bilateral trade with India over its decision in 2019 to strip the held Kashmir of its semi-autonomous status.
Tahir, who spends two months carefully restoring a single worn-out sarangi, said no one in Paki­s­tan manufactures the special steel strings due to low demand.
“There is no admiration for sarangi players and the few people who are repairing this wonderful instrument,” said Ustad Zia-ud-Din, the owner of the other Lahore repair shop, which has existed in some form for 200 years.
Efforts to adapt to the modern music scene have shown pockets of promise.
“We have invented new ways of playing, including making the sarangi semi-electric to enhance the sound during performances with modern musical instruments,” said Hassan of the academy he runs in Lahore. He has now performed several times with the adapted instrument.
One of the few students is 14-year-old Mohsin Muddasir, who has shunned instruments such as the guitar to take on the sarangi.
