0,More PTI MPAs want to back opposition in Punjab: PML-N,"Fearing another siege, opposition and dissident lawmakers move to another hotel.","LAHORE: In anticipation of yet another siege from the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) workers ahead of a crucial vote for the Punjab chief minister’s post, the opposition and dissident lawmakers of the PTI moved to a safer place from their Gulberg hotel to the airport area on Friday. 
On the other hand, the PML-N claims that over a dozen more PTI MPAs have contacted it after the Supreme Court’s nullification of the National Assembly deputy speaker’s ruling on the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Imran Khan, and they intended to support the opposition in the CM’s election.
The opposition leadership had kept close to 200 lawmakers, including at least 25 disgruntled PTI MPAs, at two hotels in Gulberg for over a week to make sure the government did not get to them. 
“Because of the law and order and space issues, the opposition and PTI dissident lawmakers have decided to move to another hotel. We will stay at a new place till the vote for the chief minister’s election takes place,” Punjab PML-N information secretary Azma Bokhari told Dawn on Friday. 

Fearing another siege, opposition and dissident lawmakers move to another hotel

Earlier this week, charged PTI workers had besieged a hotel in Gulberg where all the PML-N and PPP MPAs were staying, besides the 24 disgruntled lawmakers of the ruling party. They demanded ‘release’ of their party colleagues. Police intervention had avoided a clash between the two sides.
“We can expect a repeat of Monday’s (April 4) episode from the PTI. We want an early election for the CM so we can return to our homes,” Ms Bokhari maintained. 
She further said some more PTI lawmakers had approached the PML-N after the apex court’s verdict. “Some 25 PTI MPAs have so far pledged to vote for the opposition’s candidate for the chief minister’s election, with the total number of our supporters crossing 200. More ruling party lawmakers have contacted us after the apex court’s decision and they expressed their desire to support us. 
“The PTI parliamentary party is in complete tatters in Punjab and who knows the dissidents may form a forward bloc in the Punjab Assembly in the coming days,” Ms Bokhari observed. 
Another PML-N leader told Dawn that his party was facing problems accommodating the disgruntled PTI lawmakers. “The number of dissenting PTI MPAs is growing so fast after the apex court decision that we have asked them to start working on formation of a forward bloc in PA. Meanwhile, we will see how to accommodate them in a future scheme of things,” he said.
At least 40 per cent of the PTI lawmakers were needed to form a forward bloc. “If PM Khan is considering en masse resignations from the National and Punjab assemblies, he should think a million times as most of the PTI lawmakers will refuse to do so,” the PML-N leader claimed confidently. 
The PTI leadership has warned its MPAs against voting for the opposition’s nominee for the CM slot or they would be de-seated. However, the PML-N claims the defection clause of the Constitution was not applicable to the defectors as they weren’t planning to vote against their own party’s candidate, but one from an allied party.
The opposition’s Hamza Shehbaz is up against the PTI-PML-Q coalition’s candidate, Parvez Elahi.
The PA session is scheduled for April 16 to elect the leader of the House. However, the PML-N has approached the Lahore High Court for pulling back the session. 
In the 371-member Punjab Assembly, the PTI has 183 lawmakers, PML-Q 10, PML-N 165, PPP seven, five independents and one belonging to Rah-i-Haq Party. A candidate needs 186 votes to become chief minister. 
Federal Minister for Water Resources Moonis Elahi of the PMLQ had claimed that the government had the support of 189 lawmakers to defeat the opposition’s candidate.

1,Israeli PM gives security forces free rein after deadly attack,Palestinian Authority president Mahmud Abbas says killing of civilians will aggravate situation.,"TEL AVIV: Israel’s premier on Friday gave security agencies “full freedom” of operation to curb surging violence, after the latest deadly attack saw a Palestinian gunman kill two men in a popular nightlife area. 
“There are not and will not be limits for this war,” Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said, speaking hours after the attack in Tel Aviv. 
“We are granting full freedom of action to the army, the Shin Bet (the domestic security agency) and all security forces in order to defeat the terror,” he added, in a public address in the Israeli coastal city. 
The Palestinian movement Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, and the Islamic Jihad group praised the attack but have stopped short of claiming responsibility. 

Mahmud Abbas says killing of civilians will aggravate situation

Earlier on Friday, Israeli police said they had shot dead a Palestinian gunman who killed two Israeli men and wounded over a dozen others when he opened fire on a street of busy bars and restaurants crowded on a Thursday evening. 
Some 1,000 heavily armed police and army troops fanned out across Tel Aviv hunting for the perpetrator for hours, as locals hid in restaurant kitchens and in their homes. 
Israeli Defence Minister Benny Gantz, speaking alongside Bennett, said officers had made “around 200 arrests”, adding that “if necessary there will be thousands”. 
The two Israeli men killed were named as Tomer Morad and Eytam Magini, both 27 and childhood friends from the city of Kfar Saba, the mayor Rafi Saar said, who called them “our best sons”. Magini was due to celebrate his engagement on Friday evening, Lia Arad, the mother of his fiancée, told Israeli public TV. 
“They were supposed to celebrate their engagement party tonight, Eytam’s cousins organised it in this house where we are now sitting in mourning,” Arad said.
Morad was an avid fan of the Hapoel Tel Aviv Basketball Club, which said in a note of condolence it sent “a warm and loving hug”. The two friends are to be buried on Sunday.
Special forces confronted the attacker in the old city of Jaffa, the historic Arab district of Tel Aviv, “eliminating the terrorist by exchange of fire”, police commissioner Yaakov Shabtai said. Israel’s Shin Bet agency named the assailant as Raad Hazem, 28, from Jenin in the north of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where last week Israeli forces killed three in a raid. 
Palestinian Authority president Mahmud Abbas condemned the attack, saying “the killing of Palestinian and Israeli civilians only leads to a further deterioration of the situation”, the official Wafa news agency reported. 
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken also criticised the “terrorist attack” and said Washington stood by Israel “in the face of senseless terrorism and violence”.  A total of 13 people have been killed in attacks in Israel since March 22.

2,Punjab HOTA DG asks for salary cut,"Terms package out of proportion to amount of work, says his salary be cut from Rs1m to Rs0.5m.","LAHORE: Punjab Human Organ Transplant Authority (P-HOTA) Director General (DG) Prof Asad Aslam Khan on Friday requested the provincial government to reduce his remuneration by half, months after the salary package had been rationalised on his request at the time of his appointment.
In a letter to the Punjab Specialised Healthcare and Medical Education Department, P-HOTA DG Prof Asad Aslam wrote: “I was appointed as Administrator/DG P-HOTA in December 2021 and [have been] getting monthly salary package [of] Rs1 million since then”.

Terms package out of proportion to amount of work, says his salary be cut from Rs1m to Rs0.5m

He said the government also provided him an official car, free petrol and a driver in addition to the salary package. He explained that working hours of his office were five days a week from 9am to 5pm (Monday to Friday). Since he joined his office as DG, he said, he found out he used to complete his official assignments/work within three to four hours a day.
“After working for three and a half months I have realised that this salary package, along with the above-mentioned facilities, are out of proportion to the amount of work needed to be done by the Administrator/DG P-HOTA,” the letter stated.
Prof Aslam requested the Punjab health secretary to rationalise his salary package in the better interest of Pakistan as the remuneration was part of tax money. “I propose that my salary package as DG P-HOTA may be reduced from Rs1m to Rs0.5m,” Prof Aslam wrote.
According to an official, the government used to pay Rs1.3m salary and other facilities to his predecessor. Prof Aslam had objected to the high salary package even before his appointment in December 2021. On his request, the health department had then reduced it to Rs1 million, the official said.
