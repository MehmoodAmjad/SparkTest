In January this year, President Dr Arif Alvi had given his assent to the PMDC Bill 2022 after its passage by parliament.
The president signed the bill exercising his powers under Article 75 of the Constitution, a Presidency statement said.
In October 2022, the Senate passed the PMDC (Amendment) Bill but after inserting dozens of amendments into it already passed by the National Assembly.
The bill was moved by PPP legislator Jam Abdul Karim.
Earlier, during the long debate on the bill, opposition members alleged that the legislation was meant to create a lot of incompetent medical professionals and serve the vested interests of a mafia.
Leader of Opposition Dr Shahzad Waseem of PTI objected to the “long list"" of new amendments, suggesting the bill should be sent to the committee again.
However, the treasury benches stressed upon the urgency to have the bill passed saying it was about the future of medical students.

1,Justice Isa faces backlash for attending parliament,PTI leader Fawad calls for his resignation; Gujranwala Bar files complaint with SJC demanding his ouster from post,"Justice Qazi Faez Isa is facing criticism from various quarters for his extraordinary move to attend parliament on the golden jubilee of the 1973 Constitution, but the senior judge justified his action by saying that the event was held to commemorate an important day in the country’s history.
PTI senior leader Fawad Chaudhry accused Justice Isa of showing partiality while paying a visit to parliament and sitting among politicians.
Talking to the media at the Lahore High Court, he demanded that Justice Isa should resign.
He continued that parliament had made a mockery of the top court and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s resignation was the only solution to all the crises being faced by the country.

He pointed out that PM Shehbaz claimed that his government had faced gigantic problems during this year.
Fawad added the premier should not tweet this as the government had passed this year not only violating the Constitution, but also human rights.
He also agreed with “table talks”, saying without negotiations, no political party could move ahead.
Besides the PTI leader, the Gujranwala District Bar also lashed out at Justice Isa for attending parliament and filed a complaint against him in the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC), seeking the judge’s removal from his post.
In its complaint, the Gujranwala Bar accused Justice Isa of “misconduct” and argued that the judge had violated the code of conduct by sitting among “corrupt” politicians.
It added that the Constitution called for a distinction between the judiciary and executive.
In his defence, Justice Isa issued a clarification, which read: “All the Judges of the Supreme Court were invited to celebrate the Golden Jubilee of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.”
He added that prior to accepting the invitation, inquiries were made as to whether there would be political speeches, and assurances were extended that only the Constitution and its making would be spoken about.
“The programme sent to me also confirmed this. Having cleared this point, first by my staff from the Deputy Director of the National Assembly, and then by me directly with the Speaker, I accepted the invitation as I wanted to show solidarity with the Constitution,” he continued.
The judge maintained that he had been asked if he would like to speak and he had declined. “However, when political statements were made (in a few of the speeches), I requested to speak to correct any misconceptions that may arise, and I did so,” he claimed.
Justice Isa expressed his surprise over some people objecting to where he sat as well as his presence at the function to commemorate the Constitution.
“I would have preferred to sit in the hall on one side or in the gallery, but respect was shown to a member of the judiciary by seating me at the centre; I did not choose to sit there,” he clarified.
The judge pointed out that the Constitution was unanimously enacted by the peoples’ directly elected representatives at all ends political spectrum and that testified to their sagacity.
“It affirmed the Founder’s motto of achieving success; Unity, Faith and Discipline. It established that even the most intractable problems can be solved with sincerity and motivation when the peoples’ interest is kept paramount. I may add that the elected representatives of the people are deserving of all respect. Without the politicians of the All India Muslim League, we would not have gained independence,” he wrote.
He noted that the organisers of the Convention had invited “all to commemorate a singularly important day in Pakistan’s history”.
“The Golden Jubilee of the Constitution is a celebration of all citizens; it is not the exclusive domain of any particular political party or institution. The significance of the Constitution must be impressed upon all, and this should be done continuously,” he added.

The senior judge recalled that when Pakistan did not have a constitution enacted by the directly elected representatives of the people, the country broke apart.
“The lingering mistake was finally rectified 50 years ago and the peoples’ fundamental rights were recognised and enshrined in the Constitution. The salvation of all Pakistanis lies in adherence to the Constitution,” he highlighted.
Justice Isa further wrote that citizens were best served if seeds of discord were not planted.
“The making of the Constitution is one of the greatest moments in our history, which should be celebrated,” he concluded.

4,PM touts ‘reconciliation’ as hallmark of PDM govt,Shehbaz says coalition govt’s one year marks success story of overcoming tough challenges,"Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday hailed the policy of “reconciliation and cooperation” instead of “confrontation and vendetta” during his first year in office, claiming that the government “largely succeeded” in its endeavours.
In a series of tweets marking one year since he took oath as the prime minister following the exit of Imran Khan from office through a no-confidence motion in April last year, Shehbaz reflected on the developments and achievements of his government.
“Today marks the completion of one year since I took oath as the PM of a coalition government. This has been a time of massive challenges and difficulties. It was a long journey, but sustained efforts made it possible,” he said in one of his tweets.
“I can inform people that over the last one year, we have largely succeeded in establishing Pakistan’s credibility as a partner and friend,” he tweeted. “All predictions of default turned out to be false alarms. Sincere efforts are under way to revive the economy,” he added.
On April 11 last year, Shehbaz took oath of office after the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government was voted out by the National Assembly through a no-confidence motion brought by the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) in the wee hours of April 10.
Shehbaz recalled that the passage of no-confidence vote against Imran-led government was unprecedented, as it brought political forces together “to use the forum of parliament to vote out an unpopular govt” through constitutional means.
He hailed the convergence of political parties with different manifestos on a common national cause represented a “major step forward” in the country’s political evolution. “Reconciliation and cooperation instead of confrontation and vendetta marked the new politics post-April ’22.”
He said despite the economic landmines laid by Imran and the disruptions in global fuel and food supply lines, Pakistan’s economy continued to stay afloat. The government, he added, painstakingly, repaired, rebuilt and deepened Pakistan’s diplomatic relations that were dealt a severe blow by the “Niazi regime”.
He also highlighted the government’s rescue, relief, and rehabilitation efforts following the unprecedented floods in the country last year.
In the last one year, he said, the coalition government made efforts to diversify the energy mix with an aim to provide relief to the citizens.
Shehbaz pointed out that geo-strategic rivalries, increase in fuel and food prices, as well as historic floods were some of the key factors responsible for inflation.
“Mindful of its impact, the government has expanded social safety net and provided targeted subsidies,” he continued.
Under the watch of the PDM government, Pakistan managed to exit the Financial Action Task Force’s grey list, thanks to the excellent inter-ministerial coordination as well as support extended by the military leadership, the prime minister mentioned.

5,Elahi pledges support to CJ to uphold Constitution,Vows not to let Nawaz’s desire of ‘humiliating judiciary’ succeed,"PTI Central President Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi has lashed out at the prime minister, saying Shehbaz Sharif has followed the path of open rebellion against the Constitution.
The government on Monday had the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Bill, 2023 – which aims to curtail the powers of the chief justice of Pakistan to take suo motu notice and constitute benches on his own – passed by the joint sitting of parliament. The bill had been returned by President Arif Alvi to parliament for reconsideration.
During a meeting with senior Punjab bureaucrats, including Chaudhry Zulfiqar Ghuman, Chaudhry Waseem Ramey, Abdullah Yusuf Waraich, and others, on Monday, Elahi said: “Shehbaz Sharif is being given direct instructions by the government's ‘godfather’ (Nawaz Sharif) from London.”
The PTI central president, “Parliament cannot refuse to provide funds to the Election Commission of Pakistan [for holding elections].
“Anyone who refuses will be held in contempt of court.”
In the judicial wrangling among the Supreme Court judges, Elahi said, “The entire nation stands with Chief Justice (Umar Ata Bandial) to uphold the supremacy of the Constitution.”
Elahi vowed not to let Nawaz’s desire of “humiliating the judiciary” succeed.
On the one hand, he said, the 50th anniversary of the Constitution was being celebrated while on the other, the same Constitution was being flouted

Elahi urged the Pakistan Peoples Party not be involved in the conspiracy to break the Constitution, “if it claims to have made the Constitution”.
In the form of Shehbaz, he said, the nation had been humiliated for a year.
“The lesson of the last year is that Shahbaz Sharif and Pakistan cannot go together anymore. Shahbaz Sharif's one-year government has shaken the hearth of the country.”
He said those who had brought Shahbaz a year ago were now “regretting it”.
“The wheel of the economy has been completely jammed and the credibility of the current government in international financial institutions has become zero.
“In a year, one million youth have left the country because of disappointment while people are dying in queues for free wheat flour.
“The imported government has given the people nothing but inflation, chaos, anarchy, destruction, ruin, despair and hopelessness.”

6,Clips show Maryam getting caught off guard,Censored parts from a TV interview take social media by storm,"A couple of unaired video clips of Maryam Nawaz’s recent interview with a local TV channel show the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) chief organiser getting caught off guard when asked about her assets and Toshakhana gifts.
The video clips of the ruling party leader’s interview with anchorperson Mansoor Ali Khan were not aired but they were leaked to social media on Tuesday.
In these clips, one can see Maryam left baffled when confronted with tough questions about her father, former premier Nawaz Sharif, retaining a high-end Mercedes car from Toshakahan as prime minister during the 1990s.
Maryam initially expressed ignorance about the vehicle but when the interviewer supported his claims by documents, the PML-N leader asked him to stop recording and not to air that part of the interview.
In the censored video clip, the interviewer said Nawaz acquired a vehicle, received as a gift from a Saudi prince, from Toshakhana in violation of the Toshakhana rules.
In response to this, Maryam said that retaining a gift from Toshakhana after paying an amount as per the policy of the depository was not illegal. 
However, the anchor rebutted her claims, saying according to the rules it was not allowed to buy expensive cars from the gift repository.
In the other video, the anchorperson questioned Maryam about her alleged BMW car “which was gifted to her by the UAE’s royal family and the value of the car was declared 3.5 million in the tax year 2009-10”.
However, the PML-N leader responded saying she did not know about this and “will get back to you on this.”

9,ECP seeks powers to announce polls date,Commission seeks amendments to Elections Act,"The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has proposed amending sections 57 and 58 of the Elections Act, 2017 to empower it to change the date and schedule of the polls.
Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja had written letters to National Assembly Speaker Raja Pervez Ashraf and Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani whereas ECP Secretary Omar Hamid penned letter to Prime Minister’s Principal Secretary Tauqir Shah to get back the powers it held before changes were made in 1985.
A letter was also sent to Parliamentary Affairs Secretary Shakeel Malik. According to the proposed amendment in Section 57, the ECP will announce the date for the elections whereas as per the recommended change in Section 58, the polls supervisory body would be authorised to modify the schedule issued for elections.
It will also empower the election supervisor to change the date of the polls in view of the prevailing situation.
If the amendments to sections 57 and 58 are made and a bill in this regard is passed, the schedule given by the Supreme Court for Punjab polls can also be changed.
The apex court has set May 14 as election date for polls in Punjab.
Read ECP proposes tweaks in polls law to remove ‘ambiguity'
The CEC has requested the NA speaker and Senate chairman to get amendments in Elections Act, 2017 bill passed from the parliament, also recommending that the ECP would announce the date for polls.
The letter stated that the authority to announce the election date under the law lied with the ECP, but later in 1985, during the Zia martial law period, the polls supervisory body was deprived of the power.
It was further stated that in Daska and other “important cases”, the ECP was deprived of its authority.
Daska NA-75 by-poll, held in February 2021 was marred with allegations of ballot tampering, abduction of officers on duty and excessive police and administration influence.
The by-polls gained significant right from the attempt to gerrymander the election results to the vanishing of the ECP staff and from legal fight to re-polling under strict supervision.
The ECP had suspended the flawed verdict on February 19, and ordered re-election in the constituency. Notwithstanding litigations, the apex court too endorsed the ECP stance, and a subsequent ballot in April returned PML-N’s Syeda Nosheen Iftikhar in a cut-throat competition against PTI’s Ali Asjad Malhi.
The letter stated that inquiry against corrupt officers was dropped, which had weakened the writ of the ECP, adding that the bureaucracy was given a go-ahead for corruption.
The election supervisor stated that by proposing amendments in sections 57 and 58 of the Election Act, 2017 it was now seeking back its “original powers” as mentioned in the 1976 law, and ensure fair and transparent polls in the country.
