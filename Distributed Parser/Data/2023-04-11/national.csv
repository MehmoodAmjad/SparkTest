0,Apple takes biggest hit in Mac-book sales,Its global PC shipments fell 29% in Q1 2023,"Global shipments of personal computers (PCs) fell by nearly a third in the first quarter of 2023, with Apple Inc dropping the most among the market heavyweights as the industry struggles with a post-pandemic slowdown in consumer spending.
In separate reports published on Monday, market research firms IDC and Canalys blamed weak demand, excess inventory and a bleak economic outlook for the shipment declines of 29% and 33%, respectively.
“Most of the issues that plagued the industry in the second half of last year have extended into the start of 2023,” Canalys analyst Ishan Dutt said.
Of the top five PC companies analysed in the report, Apple’s Q1 shipments saw the largest drop of 40.5% from the same period in 2022, with Dell Technologies Inc coming in second with a drop of 31%.
Lenovo Group Ltd, Asustek Computer Inc and HP Inc also faced declines in shipments, the IDC said.
In February, Apple reported that sales of its Mac computers, which had boomed during the wave of working from home during the pandemic, declined 29% YoY to $7.7 billion in their most recent quarter.
“The preliminary results also represented a coda to the era of COVID-driven demand and at least a temporary return to pre-COVID patterns. Shipment volume in Q1 2023 was noticeably lower than the 59.2 million units shipped in Q1 2019 and 60.6 million in Q1 2018,” IDC said.
“The pause in growth and demand is also giving the supply chain some room to make changes as many factories begin to explore production options outside China.”
Concerns over slowdowns in major economies remain, with recent tumult in the banking sector exacerbating worries that runaway inflation and tight monetary policy would hamper growth and financial investments.
If the economy is trending upwards by 2024, “we expect significant market upside as consumers look to refresh, schools seek to replace worn-down Chromebooks, and businesses move to Windows 11,” said Linn Huang, research vice president, Devices and Displays at IDC.
“If recession in key markets drags on into next year, recovery could be a slog.”

1,Saudis maintain crude supply to Asian refiners,Move comes despite pledge to cut output by 500k barrels per day from May,"State oil giant Saudi Aramco will supply full crude contract volumes loading in May to several North Asian buyers despite its pledge to cut output by 500,000 barrels per day, several sources with knowledge of the matter said on Monday.
This comes after OPEC+ surprised markets last week by announcing an extra output cut of 1.16 million barrels per day (bpd) from May for the rest of the year.
Saudi Aramco’s monthly allocation was being keenly watched by investors as an indicator of whether planned output cuts could tighten supplies in Asia, the world’s biggest crude import market.
People are wondering whether the additional voluntary cut will actually affect supply, or whether it is designed just to shore up oil prices, said a source at an Asian refiner who declined to be named as he is not authorised to speak to media.
The OPEC+ announcement caused Brent and US West Texas Intermediate crude futures, to jump 6% last week, returning to levels last seen in November.
Last week, Saudi Aramco also surprised the market by raising prices for the flagship Arab Light crude it sells to Asia for a third month in May. It also increased the prices of other oil grades to Asian clients amid expectations of tighter market supply.
Asia’s oil demand had been expected to weaken in the second quarter as several refiners in Asia, namely Sinopec, South Korea’s third largest refiner and Aramco affiliate S-Oil Corp, Japan’s Fuji Oil and Idemitsu Kosan are shutting a combined 1.15 million bpd of crude distillation capacity in May.
Still, some investors are bullish about a recovery in China’s oil demand and expect global oil markets to tighten in the second half this year and push prices towards $100 a barrel.
Meanwhile, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, a state-owned oil giant from the United Arab Emirates, has informed at least three buyers in Asia that it will supply full contractual volumes of crude in June, trade sources said.
The UAE plans to cut 144,000 bpd from May as part of the OPEC+ cuts.

2,China eyes ‘West to East’ green hydrogen pipeline,"Transmission line will have initial capacity of 100,000 tonnes per year","China’s Sinopec will build a pipeline to transfer hydrogen from renewable energy projects in China’s northwestern Inner Mongolia region to cities in its east, according to a report in state media outlet Xinhua on Monday.
The pipeline will stretch 400 km from Ulanqab in sparsely populated Inner Mongolia to the capital Beijing, and will have an initial capacity of 100,000 tonnes per year, said the report, citing Sinopec Chairman Ma Yongsheng.
Ports will be built along the pipeline to allow access to new potential hydrogen sources, the report added.
While the country already operates pipelines for so-called “grey hydrogen” produced from fossil fuel sources, the project is the country’s first ‘West to East’ green hydrogen transmission line, according to the report.
Green hydrogen is produced by splitting water molecules with renewable electricity, and touted as a clean replacement for fossil fuels in industries that are otherwise hard to decarbonise.
State-owned oil and gas giant Sinopec is China’s largest hydrogen producer. It announced this year it would build a green hydrogen plant in the Inner Mongolian city of Ordos, with planned annual capacity of 30,000 tonnes.
The company also launched a green hydrogen project in Kuqa in the western Xinjiang region in 2021.
China’s state planner last year announced a target to produce 100,000 to 200,000 tonnes of green hydrogen a year and have about 50,000 hydrogen-fuelled vehicles by 2025, as the country pursues an ambitious campaign to transition towards renewable energy.
In neighbouring India, a top government official said last week that India is planning to give green hydrogen fuel producers incentives worth at least 10% of their costs under a $2 billion scheme set to begin before the end of June.

3,Rupee falls by Rs2.44 against dollar,Analysts pointed out that the currency market still harboured doubts about the resumption of IMF programme,"Pakistani currency dropped by 0.85%, or Rs2.44, to a five-day low at Rs287.09 against the US dollar in inter-bank market on Monday amid conflicting reports about the revival of International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) loan programme.
With the fresh depreciation, the rupee stood just Rs0.76 shy of the record low of Rs287.85/$, touched on April 5, 2023, according to the central bank data.
The rupee’s fall encouraged the gold pricing body to jack up the precious metal’s price by Rs3,100 to a new all-time high at Rs217,700 per tola (11.66 grams).
Analysts pointed out that the currency market still harboured doubts about the resumption of IMF programme anytime soon, adding that the situation sparked panic buying of dollars by the importers.
They said that the government had been making tall claims since long that the IMF would resume its $6.5 billion programme in a few days, but nothing concrete had emerged so far.
“The rupee’s downward march will halt once the government clinches a staff-level agreement with the IMF,” an analyst remarked.
He said that it was very difficult to project where the rupee-dollar exchange rate would settle in the near future.
“We are living in abnormal circumstances, which do not allow any prediction about the exchange rate...economic activities are on the wane while inflation and interest rate are soaring.”
Meanwhile, the All Pakistan Saraf Gems and Jewellers Association (APSGJA) reported that the gold price fell $6 to $2,002 per ounce (31.10 grams) in the international market.
However, the rupee depreciation forced the association to revise the price of the imported commodity upwards.

5,Gaming industry revenue to cross $200m in 2023,Annual growth rate of 9.77% is expected from 2023-2027,"Pakistan’s gaming industry is on the rise, but it has yet to reach its full potential, according to industry experts.
Pakistan Software Houses Association ([email protected]) Chairman, Muhammad Zohaib Khan has predicted that the gaming industry’s revenue will cross $200 million in 2023, with an annual growth rate of 9.77% from 2023-2027. However, he believes that Pakistan’s gaming industry is still not benefiting from its true potential.
“Mobile games alone have generated $171.30 million in 2022. As per the latest statistics, $21.34 million were generated by online games and $16.13 million through download games as well,” said the [email protected] chief.
According to the CEO of Si Global, Noman Ahmed, “Despite the gaming industry being highly profitable, Pakistan is not benefiting from it as much as it could. Investing in the future is crucial, and the government’s support for the growth of technology in Pakistan is promising.”
“One initiative that could help Pakistan’s gaming industry is the establishment of training centres for aspiring game developers,” he said, adding that, “Although the gaming industry’s global volume is over $500 billion, Pakistan’s share is limited to $50 million, which could be increased significantly with initiatives like establishing a local gaming and animation industry.”
Kapeel Kumar, a specialist in startup investment, believes that this investment would revolutionise research and innovation in gaming, VFX, computer vision, and AI through a robust ecosystem that involves collaboration with tech partners, industry, investors, industry associations, and the government.
Kumar said that the aim is to boost indigenous product development while propelling the growth of tech entrepreneurship in the country, with a particular focus on the youth. He believes that by collaborating with industry partners, the model can be built on a solid foundation to realise the mission of building world-class gaming, animation, and deep tech providers for the world.
The [email protected] chairman referred to Statista Market Forecast and the International Trade Center (ITC) and explained that Pakistan has the potential to become the next regional hub in game development as 64% of its population is young, and through targeted skills development, Pakistan can surpass its yearly projections.
He reiterated his stance, however, that the federal government, SBP & FBR need to adapt their practices and regulations to international best practices vis-à-vis foreign exchange management and allow the IT & ITeS industry to freely manage their hard-earned foreign exchange to fund their businesses, reinvest into their entities, invest into marketing, sales and networking, and, at the same time, contribute to strengthening Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves.
Khan stressed that, “We can easily add 3000 gaming developers to the human resource (HR) pool every year, and in that fashion, Pakistan can comfortably attain a 30% year-on-year growth in the gaming industry’s foreign remittances, provided we can invest in HR & skills development for aspiring game developers.”
Pakistan’s gaming industry currently employs around 8,500 game developers in three major sub-sectors, namely gaming products, middleware, and gaming services.
The collaboration between industry and government would ensure that the model is built on a solid foundation, making it possible to build world-class gaming, animation, and deep tech providers. In conclusion, the investment in training centers for game developers is an essential step towards realizing Pakistan’s potential in the gaming and tech industries, leading to economic growth and prosperity.
It is pertinent to note that [email protected] and its member firms supported and participated in the Game Developers Conference 2023 held in California with the support of the Trade Development Authority of Pakistan, Ministry of IT & Telecom, USAID, and Pakistani Consulate in Los Angeles. The Pakistan Pavilion attracted the movers and shakers of the global gaming fraternity due to the excellent presentation of the game development potential in Pakistan.

6,Remittances hit 7-month high at $2.5b,"Overseas Pakistanis send funds for Ramazan, rupee depreciates","Overseas Pakistanis sent home a record-breaking $2.53 billion in remittances in March, giving the country hope for a future current account surplus. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) announced that the inflows of workers’ remittances increased by 27.4% compared to the prior month of February 2023.
The sharp rise in remittances can be attributed to two main factors, according to Fahad Rauf, Head of Research at Ismail Iqbal Securities. Speaking to the Express Tribune, Rauf said, “Firstly, the ongoing holy month of Ramzan has led non-resident Pakistanis to send higher funds to their family members, to cope with the high food prices during this period. Secondly, the significant depreciation in the rupee against the US dollar in recent months has encouraged a greater number of overseas Pakistanis to send their funds through official channels like banks and exchange companies, instead of through illegal hawala-hundi operators.”
Moreover, the rupee-dollar exchange rate has depreciated by almost 20%, or Rs57, to Rs287/$ on Monday compared to Rs230/$ in late January 2023. While this has previously led some overseas Pakistanis to opt to send remittances through black market channels due to the better conversion rate of US dollar into Pakistani rupee, the low exchange rate currently offered by banks and exchange companies has convinced a majority of them to send their funds through official channels.
The remittances are an essential source of foreign earning for the government and helps stabilise foreign exchange reserves. The inflows are usually utilised to finance the trade deficit in Pakistan.
JS Global Head of Research Amreen Soorani commented, “With remittances widely surpassing trade deficit (reported by Pakistan Bureau of Statistics/PBS) this month, the possibility of a current account surplus increases to a great extent.”
PBS reported the trade deficit at $1.46 billion compared to remittances at $2.53 billion in March.
Soorani noted that the trade deficit complied by the SBP is usually even lower than the PBS trade deficit. PBS’s trade data is based on the arrival and departure of goods at domestic ports, while the central bank compiles the data on the basis of import and export payments. Therefore, their numbers usually differ. SBP trade data for March 2023 is awaited.
However, other experts have said that the likely current account surplus is no reason to celebrate, as this is a result of controlled imports instead of increased exports. The low imports have hit industrial output severely and taken millions of jobs.
The central bank reported a current account deficit of $74 million, missing a surplus slightly in February 2023. The receipt of workers’ remittances, however, dropped 10.7% to $2.53 billion in March compared to $2.83 billion in the same month of the previous year.
Cumulatively in the first nine months (Jul-Mar) of FY23, remittances declined by 10.8% to $20.52 billion compared to $23 billion in the same period
last year, according to the central bank.
Rauf said that remittances may maintain around $2.50 billion in April due to the Ramzan and Eidul Azha factor. “The flows in May and June will actually explain the future trend in remittances.”
However, overseas Pakistanis may opt to send limited remittances until the International Monetary Fund (IMF) program is resumed, as they still doubt the rupee’s stability and believe it may further depreciate in case of a further delay in the revival of the loan program.
Historical data suggests that remittances usually peak in Ramzan or around Eid festivals every year. However, this year, the sustainability of the trend is doubtful. According to the Rauf, remittances hit a peak of $3.12 billion in April of the previous year, and it is doubtful that the monthly flow of remittances would exceed that all-time high during the current fiscal year.
The government of Pakistan has been controlling imports in order to manage its critically low foreign exchange reserves, which currently stand at $4.24 billion, and to address the high risk of default on foreign debt repayment, which is expected to reach $4.5 billion by the end of June 2023.
An IMF programme, however, is expected to unlock billions of dollars in foreign funding, improve foreign exchange reserves, and mitigate the risk of default.
Country-wise remittances
In terms of country-wise remittances, workers’ remittances from Saudi Arabia rose by 24% to $564 million in March, compared to $455 million in February 2022. Meanwhile, inflows from the UK increased by 33% to $422 million, compared to $317 million previously.
Remittances from the UAE also saw a rise of 26% to $407 million, compared to $324 million, while remittances from the US jumped by 44% to $316 million, compared to $219 million.
Remittances from EU countries surged by 22% to $299 million, compared to $245 million, and inflows from other countries increased by 23% to $525 million in March, compared to $427 million in the previous month of February.

7,10% Hajj quota surrendered to Riyadh,Govt makes decision owing to very low foreign currency reserves,"Pakistan on Monday decided to surrender 10% of the government’s Hajj quota to Saudi Arabia and approved the provision of additional $163 million for financing the pilgrimage after it could not succeed in plans to ease the burden on the country’s thin foreign exchange reserves through outsourcing the official quota.
The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet changed its month-old decision, which required half of the intending pilgrims to arrange foreign currency from abroad owing to the alarmingly low official foreign exchange reserves.
ECC, after discussion, approved the arrangement and modalities for the Hajj Scheme 2023 and decided that all the received applications under the regular Hajj scheme, 72,869 in total, would be declared successful without balloting, according to the finance ministry.
ECC also approved an additional financing requirement of $163 million in foreign exchange for this year’s Hajj.
With the fresh approval, the government will provide $213 million to finance Hajj expenses, which is far lower than what it would have provided under normal economic conditions in the country.
The Hajj Policy 2023 required that the Hajj quota of 179,210 for Pakistan would be distributed equally between the government and private schemes.
Under the regular Hajj scheme, about 89,605 pilgrims were supposed to go on the pilgrimage. In order to lessen the burden on foreign exchange market, the government set aside 44,802 applications that would be financed by arranging foreign currency from abroad.
ECC was informed that contrary to the hope of receiving 44,802 sponsorships, less than 8,000 got funding from abroad. As a result, the government could not get $194 million from abroad to finance the Hajj expenses.
The cabinet had instructed the finance ministry to provide $90 million and the remaining $194 million for government quota had to come from abroad.
Under the regular government scheme, 72,869 applications
had been received against 44,190 seats.
The last date for submitting applications under the sponsorship scheme was April 7 but the Ministry of Religious Affairs expected less than 8,000 applications against 44,190 seats.
Because of the poor response to the outsourcing scheme, the ECC decided that the surplus quota would be surrendered to Saudi Arabia. The situation arose due to the government’s inability to provide foreign exchange to the intending pilgrims.
As a result, based on estimates of the Ministry of Religious Affairs, at least 8,800 pilgrims, or nearly 10%, under the government quota cannot perform Hajj this year.
Last month, the government had increased Hajj expenses to Rs1.175 million per pilgrim, a surge of 68% over last year.
ECC had been informed in March that the sponsorship scheme of the government’s Hajj quota would generate about $194 million and the private Hajj scheme would fetch more than $250 million, depending on the cost of packages and applications received, taking the total outsourced funds to $444 million.
The sponsorship scheme was expected to secure foreign exchange cover for the regular scheme as well.
The religious affairs ministry had decided in consultation with the Finance Division that the remaining quota of the sponsorship scheme would be shifted to the regular scheme and thereby all applicants, ie 72,869 (against 44,190 seats), be declared successful without balloting.
Resultantly, 28,679 seats of the sponsorship scheme were required to be utilised through the regular scheme.
The ministry needs a net $213 million for Hajj 2023, of which $50 million has already been released and the remaining $163 million is required from the Finance Division.

8,Oil slips after three weeks,Rate hike worries balanced prospect of tighter supplies,"Oil slipped on Monday, after rising for three straight weeks, as concern about further interest rate hikes that could curb demand balanced the prospect of a tighter market due to supply cuts from OPEC+ producers.
The US dollar rose after US jobs data pointed to a tight labour market, firming up expectations of another Federal Reserve rate hike. Dollar strength makes oil more expensive for other currency holders.
Brent crude was down 54 cents, or 0.6%, at $84.58 a barrel by 1723 GMT on Monday. US West Texas Intermediate slipped 54 cents, or 0.7%, to $80.16.
“We look for this week’s trade to be heavily influenced by inflation data that will likely revive the spectre of higher interest rates that could strengthen the US dollar,” said Jim Ritterbusch, President of Ritterbusch and Associates in Galena.
