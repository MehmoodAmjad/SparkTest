0,AJK PM sent packing over contempt,High court disqualifies Tanvir Ilyas over anti-judiciary statements; refuses to accept apology,"The Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) High Court on Tuesday disqualified Prime Minister Tanvir Ilyas from his position as a member of the legislative assembly and as premier on contempt charges.
The AJK Election Commission Secretariat issued a notification, stating: “Pursuant to the judgment dated April 11, 2023 passed by the Honourable High Court of Azad Jammu and Kashmir in Robkar Adalat vs Tanvir Ilyas, Prime Minister Govt of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and sub-article (2) of Article 25 of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Interim Constitution 1974, the Chief Election Commissioner AJK hereby issued notification of disqualification of Tanvir Ilyas as member AJK Legislative Assembly.”
It is “with effect from April 11, 2023 in consequence thereof the notification dated July 27, 2021 to the extent of declaring him as returned candidate from the AJK Legislative Assembly Constituency No LA-XV, Bagh-II stands rescinded with effect from April 11, 2023.”
On Monday, the superior courts of AJK served notices to Ilyas seeking an explanation about his position on derogatory remarks about the judiciary in speeches at public gatherings. The prime minister was asked to appear before the AJK High Court and Supreme Court on Tuesday.
Ilyas had accused the judiciary of affecting the work of his government and intervening in the domain of the executive through stay orders.
The AJK premier had claimed that a multimillion Saudi-funded education project was incomplete due to a court order. He also spoke against the court orders to reopen tobacco factories that were involved in tax evasion worth billions of rupees.
On Tuesday, the full bench of the high court pronounced the verdict, convicted him for statements against the judiciary and sentenced him.
The court took notice of Ilyas’ anti-judiciary statements and did not accept his apology.

With Ilyas’s disqualification, the entire AJK cabinet now stands dissolved.
The move comes amid heightened political tensions across Pakistan due to the crisis relating to the elections in Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa after assemblies in both the provinces were dissolved.
Ilyas, affiliated with the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), served as the premier of AJK for less than a year. He was elected unopposed as the 14th prime minister of the region on April 18, 2022.
After the resignation of Abdul Qayyum Khan Niazi as the AJK premier, Illyas had submitted nomination papers on behalf of the PTI which were declared valid by the assembly secretary.
PTI Chairman Imran Khan nominated Ilyas as the party’s candidate for the Prime Minister Office while the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and the Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) had jointly fielded Chaudhry Yasin.
The united opposition boycotted the session for the election of the prime minister, leaving no candidate in the race against Ilyas wherein he secured 33 votes in his favour.
The first prime minister of AJK, Khan Abdul Hameed Khan, was elected on July 5, 1975. AJK has had a parliamentary system since 1985. Sardar Sikandar Hayat, Sardar Atiq Ahmad Khan, and Raja Farooq Haider Khan had twice held the office of AJK PM.

1,Zardari holds out olive branch to Imran’s party,PPP co-chairman calls for ‘unconditional’ talks with PTI,"Holding out an olive branch to the PTI, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari has urged Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to initiate ‘unconditional’ talks with the opposition, as ""the door for talks should never be closed in politics"".
""The prime minister has the authority to initiate talks. I will request Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to hold talks with the opposition,"" Zardari said while addressing a joint session of parliament on Monday.
The PPP co-chairman, who served as the country's 11th president from 2008 to 2013, also advised the opposition, the PTI, not to set any preconditions for talks.
Zardari offer came as PTI senior leader Fawad Fawad Chaudhry had praised the PPP for passing a resolution stating that it did not want to become party to the campaign to malign judges and asserting that political parties did not block negotiations.
“The PTI is also for the holding of dialogues and wants that the establishment, government, and opposition should sit together, discuss and give space — while acknowledging the right of election,” Chaudhry had said while speaking at a news conference in Lahore last week, where he applauded what he called the “political acumen” demonstrated by Asif Ali Zardari’s party.
The former president said, the opposition will also have to sit down across the table with Shehbaz ""as he is the prime minister of the country"".
Referring to the legacy of his party, he said: ""We have been protecting Pakistan and will continue to protect it in future. We will hand down an integrated and not disintegrated Pakistan to the next generation.
The former president claimed that his party would not allow anyone to violate the Constitution. He said the pro-democracy forces have always been conspired against throughout the history of the country. ""We will, however, continue to safeguard democracy as long as we are alive. Pakistan will rise again,"" he added.
Meanwhile, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, who also serves as the foreign minister in Prime Minister Shehbaz's cabinet, also called for unity among political and democratic forces, while adding that all institutions should work in their constitutional ambit to bring Pakistan out of various problems including  inflation, unemployment and terrorism
Speaking at a convention held in connection with the golden jubilee celebrations of the 1973 constitution, he said the undemocratic forces have always taken advantage of differences among the politicians and political parties in the past.
""It was about time to forge unity and work jointly for political and economic stability in the country,"" he added. He said the 1973 constitution which was unanimously passed by the parliament had ensured the integrity of the country.
""April 10 is a historic day and this day should be a part of the syllabus so that the new generation knows the importance of the constitution.""
He said PPP founder and former premier Zulfikar Ali Bhutto united the broken and scattered country through a unanimous constitution in 1973,
""The Constitution of 1973 gave the country a way forward to tread the path of progress and constitutionalism. [PPP former chairperson] Shaheed Benazir Bhutto and [former premier] Nawaz Sharif inked a charter of democracy (CoD) in 2006 as the undemocratic forces always took advantage of differences and communication gaps among the political forces in the past.
""The PPP not only restored the 1973 constitution in letter and spirit but also provided rights to the provinces besides giving them their identity
“However, undemocratic forces started conspiracies against the CoD and imposed a selected prime minister aimed at abrogating the unanimous constitution of 1973 and clearing the way for setting up of One Unit again in the country,” he said.
Bilawal said some elements in various institutions did not want the CoD and unity among political forces.
“Such elements wanted their selected rule in the country besides imposing a selected [PM] again for their personal gains. They had a 10-year plan and if that doctrine continued, there would be the murder of merit in other institutions,” he added.

2,Onus on parliament to pay for elections,Parliament passes bill to finance elections raising stakes in govt-judiciary standoff,"The government on Monday introduced a ‘money bill’ in parliament to settle the dispute over making Rs21 billion payments to the Election Commission of Pakistan for holding polls in two provinces - a move that may further deepen frictions between the executive and the judiciary.
Through the introduction of a new bill the government has shifted the onus of approving Rs21 billion funds on parliament besides gaining more time for releasing money that the Supreme Court of Pakistan had directed to disburse to the ECP by April 10.
However, till the deadline, the ECP did not receive the money from the government.
Finance Minister Ishaq Dar introduced the “Charged Sums for General Elections (Provincial Assemblies of the Punjab and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa)” Bill 2023 in both the houses of parliament.
The bill is aimed at carving a legal way for the release of Rs21 billion funds for holding elections in Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.
Dar introduced the piece of legislation as ‘money bill’, which gives the voting right on it to the National Assembly and a maximum 14-day time to the Senate to give the recommendations on the bill.
In case of the bill, the Senate’s recommendations are non-binding on the National Assembly.
The finance minister introduced the bill the day the federal government was bound under a court judgment to provide funds to the ECP.
However, the government has not accepted the Supreme Court judgment, describing it as invalid due to dispute over the number of apex court judges backing it.
Last week, the Supreme Court ordered the ECP to hold elections in two provinces on May 14, directing the federal government to release Rs21 billion to the ECP by April 10 (Monday). But the federal cabinet on Sunday decided to refer the matter to parliament.
Clause 3 of the bill stated, “The sums payable to the Election Commission for general election to the province of the Punjab and the province of the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa shall be an expenditure charged upon the Federal Consolidated Fund (FCF).”
The FCF has been defined as having “all revenues received by the federal government, all loans raised by that government and all moneys received by it in repayment of any loan, shall form part of a consolidated fund”.
The same definition has been given in the Constitution.
The bill stated that the law is being made under Article 81 (e) of the Constitution. Article 81 (e) says, “Any other sums declared by the Constitution or by Act of Parliament to be charged” upon the federal consolidated fund.
Through the bill, the government has adopted the path given in Article 79 of the Constitution, which gives custody of the FCF to parliament.
Had the government not moved the bill, it would have to give the funds to the ECP under Article 84 of the Constitution that deals with the supplementary and excess grants in a fiscal year.
By moving the bill, the government has gained time, as the matter has now been referred to the Senate that will also take a few days to give its recommendations.
The finance minister also laid the bill before the upper house of parliament.
Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani said that the notices for the proposal to make recommendations on the money bill should be submitted by the members to the Senate Secretariat by Thursday, April 13.
The proposal received for making recommendations on the money bill will be sent to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue which will submit its report by Friday, April 14, he added. The Senate would consider the committee’s report and make recommendations to the National Assembly.
In case of the charged expenditure, the National Assembly did not have the right to vote it out, as these expenses are considered constitutionally obligated. But still, parliament's endorsement is needed.
Currently, the expenses by the president, the Supreme Court of Pakistan, election commissioner, parliament, the office of the Election Commission and the auditor general for Pakistan are among the charged expenses.
The bill stated that it shall “override other laws” and have effect “notwithstanding anything contained in any other law, rules and regulations” when it will be in force.
It added that the proposed law would stand repealed once elections for both the assemblies were held, noting that the general elections and polls to the Sindh and Balochistan assemblies need not be held for it to be repealed.
Dar on Monday criticised the former PTI government, blaming it for the current economic crisis.
Dar once again threw the responsibility of the delay in the IMF deal on the PTI, claiming that his government was making all-out efforts to complete the IMF programme and the staff-level agreement would be signed soon.
Lack of $6 billion financing and the petrol subsidy remain two biggest hurdles in the way of the staff-level agreement.
Dar said that the PTI dissolved the Punjab and K-P assemblies under a planned conspiracy to create a constitutional crisis in the country. He maintained that holding elections in the country was a constitutional responsibility but contended that it was important to hold polls across the country simultaneously under caretaker governments.
“This will help in saving money and holding elections freely, fairly and in a transparent manner,” the minister stressed. “Under the Constitution of Pakistan, the sovereignty of parliament is a reality,” the finance minister said.
The ECP estimated the total cost of holding elections in these two provinces at Rs20.5 billion, excluding Rs5 billion that will be needed for by-elections on the National Assembly seats. In case the elections are held on the same day, the government anticipates Rs9.3 billion savings.
He stated that the ECP was responsible for holding free and fair elections but contended that holding polls right now was not in Pakistan’s national interest, given the current economic and security situation.
Dar said that the top court’s verdict was a “minority” judgment and parliament, therefore, had urged the government not to implement it.
The federal cabinet, in its recent meetings, decided that the SC’s order for the release of election funds will be presented in parliament for discussion, he concluded.
